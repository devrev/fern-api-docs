# Attachments extraction phase

For the Attachment Extraction phase of the import process,
the Extractor has to upload each attachment to DevRevâ€™s S3 using the `S3Interact` API. 

After uploading an attachment or a batch of attachments, the extractor also has to prepare and upload a file specifying
the extracted and uploaded attachments.

It should contain the DevRev IDs of the extracted and uploaded attachments, along with the parent domain object ID
from the external system and the actor ID from the external system.

The uploaded artifact is structured like a normal artifact containing extracted data in JSON Lines format with specifying the
`ssor_attachment` as an item type.

## Examples

Here is an example of an SSOR attachment file:
```json
[
	{
		"id": {
			"external": "don:core:dvrv-us-1:devo/1:artifact/1" // The DON of the uploaded artifact
		},
		"parent_id": {
			"external": "12345", // ID of the parent in the source system
		},
		"actor_id": {
			"external": "123456", // ID of the uploader in the source system
		}
	},
	{
		"id": {
			"external": "don:core:dvrv-us-1:devo/1:artifact/2" // The DON of the uploaded artifact
		},
		"parent_id": {
			"external": "12344", // ID of the parent in the source system
		},
		"actor_id": {
			"external": "123457", // ID of the uploader in the source system
		}
	}
]
```
