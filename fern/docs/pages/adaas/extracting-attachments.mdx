For the attachment extraction phase of the import process, the extractor has to upload each attachment to DevRevâ€™s S3 using the `S3Interact` API.

## Triggering event

Airdrop initiates the Attachment Extraction by starting the snap-in with a message with eventType `EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_START`
when transitioning to the Data Extraction phase.

During the Attachment Extraction phase,
the snap-in extracts attachments from the External System and uploads them as Artifacts to DevRev.

The snap-in must respond to Airdrop with a message with eventType `EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_PROGRESS` together with an optional progress estimate and relevant Artifacts
when it extracts some data and the maximum snap-in runtime (12 minutes) has been reached.

The snap-in must respond to Airdrop with a message with eventType `EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_DELAY` and specify a back-off time
when the extraction has been rate-limited by the External System and back-off is required.

In both cases, Airdrop starts the snap-in with a message with eventType `EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_CONTINUE`.
The restart is immediate (in case of `EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_PROGRESS`) or delayed
(in case of `EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_DELAY`).

Once the Attachment Extraction phase is done, the snap-in must respond to Airdrop with a message with eventType `EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_DONE`.

If Attachment Extraction failed, the snap-in must respond to Airdrop with a message with eventType `EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_ERROR`.

## Snap-in response

After uploading an attachment or a batch of attachments, the extractor also has to prepare and upload a file specifying
the extracted and uploaded attachments.

It should contain the DevRev IDs of the extracted and uploaded attachments, along with the parent domain object ID
from the external system and the actor ID from the external system.

The uploaded artifact is structured like a normal artifact containing extracted data in JSON Lines format with specifying the
`ssor_attachment` as an item type.

## Examples

Here is an example of an SSOR attachment file:
```json
[
	{
		"id": {
			"external": "don:core:dvrv-us-1:devo/1:artifact/1" // The DON of the uploaded artifact
		},
		"parent_id": {
			"external": "12345", // ID of the parent in the source system
		},
		"actor_id": {
			"external": "123456", // ID of the uploader in the source system
		}
	},
	{
		"id": {
			"external": "don:core:dvrv-us-1:devo/1:artifact/2" // The DON of the uploaded artifact
		},
		"parent_id": {
			"external": "12344", // ID of the parent in the source system
		},
		"actor_id": {
			"external": "123457", // ID of the uploader in the source system
		}
	}
]
```
