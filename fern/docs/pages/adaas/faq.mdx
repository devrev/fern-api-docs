## Airdrop template repository

> #### :question: I'm getting a `Conflict` error after the `Creating snap-in package...` message when running `make deploy`

:white_check_mark: A snap-in package with the same slug already exists.
Override the ``SNAP_IN_SLUG`` variable by explicitly updating the variable in `scripts/vars.sh`.

> #### :question: Snap-in version `build/deployment failed` after the `Waiting for snap-in version to be ready...` message

:white_check_mark: The snap-in version could not be built.
Check the logs by running the DevRev CLI command. For prettier UI, pipe the output to `jq`.
```
devrev snap_in_package logs | jq
```

## Token handling

> #### :question: "Token is expired" when deploying or cleaning up

:white_check_mark: Authentication token to the \`DEV_ORG\` has expired. Reauthenticate the organization by running.
```
make auth
```
