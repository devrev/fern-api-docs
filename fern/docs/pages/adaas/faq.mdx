## ADaaS template repository

#### Q: I'm getting a __Conflict__ error after the _Creating snap-in package..._ message when running _make deploy_

A: A snap-in package with the same slug already exists.
Override the `SNAP_IN_SLUG` variable by explicitly updating the variable in `scripts/vars.sh`.

##### Q: Snap-in version _build/deployment failed_ after the _Waiting for snap-in version to be ready..._ message

A: The snap-in version could not be built.
Check the logs by running the DevRev CLI command, for prettier UI, pipe the output to _jq_.
```
devrev snap_in_package logs | jq
```

## Token handling

###### Q: `Token is expired` when deploying or cleaning up

A: Authentication token to the `DEV_ORG` has expired. Reauthenticate the organization by running.
```
make auth
```
