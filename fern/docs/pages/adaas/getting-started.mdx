1. Create a new repo from the ADaaS template repo:
On [https://github.com/devrev/adaas-template](https://github.com/devrev/adaas-template) use the dropdown button `Use this template` and
then `Create a new repository`.
2. If you have not created a development organization on DevRev before, create a dedicated
[DevOrg for development purposes](https://app.devrev.ai/) where you will be publishing your ADaaS snap-in.
3. Install required tools and packages:
   - [devrev-cli](https://developer.devrev.ai/snapin-development/references/cli-install) (version 4.7 or higher)
   - [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq)
   - [golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)
   - [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) (version 18.x.x+ or higher)
4. Copy `Makefile.variable.example` to `Makefile.variable` and fill in the required variables.
5. Configure a keyring for the external system in the `manifest.yaml`.
See [Keyrings](../references/keyrings/introduction.mdx).
6. Deploy a draft version of your Snap-In to you DevOrg using `make deploy`.
7. Install the snap-in in your DevRev DevOrg on the web by navigating to **Settings** -> **Snap-ins** -> **Install snap-in**.
8. Define the `Connection`.
9. Create an `Import.`


## Creating keyrings

Keyrings are a DevRev-specific mechanism for managing authentication to external systems.
They are called **Connections** in the DevRev app.

Keyrings provide a secure way to store and manage credentials within your DevRev Snap-In.
This eliminates the need to expose sensitive information like passwords
or access tokens directly within your code or configuration files, enhancing overall security. They also provide a valid
token by abstracting Oauth token renewal from the end user.

A keyring is used by a worker to authenticate to the external system in API calls. They includes the key (for example,
a PAT token or API key), its type, the organization ID for which a key is valid, and in some cases the organization name.

Read more about keyrings in the [developer documentation](/snapin-development/references/keyrings).


## Observability

To observe logs from your snap-in in your development environment use `devrev snap_in_package logs | jq`.
To open logs in your favorite editor use `devrev snap_in_package logs | code -`
