Airdrop is DevRev’s solution to migrate data. It allows our customers to bring in their existing data from
load data from external systems and, export data back to external systems, and keep data in sync between DevRev and the external systems.
You can read more about Airdrop in the [general documentation](https://docs.devrev.ai/import#airdrop-features).

Airdrop-as-a-Service (ADaaS) gives snap-in developers the ability to integrate with DevRev’s Airdrop functionality.
It enables developers to create external workers (extractors and loaders) to bring data from various external systems.

An extractor is an function in an ADaaS-capable snap-in responsible for extracting data from an external system, such as Jira, Zendesk,
or HubSpot. It uses a standardized communication protocol for talking to Airdrop and a standardized
data structure for all the files it extracts and processes, so that they can be seamlessly imported into DevRev.

## Sync runs

Airdrop functions are executed in the context of sync runs, which is a directed operation that spans over many invocations
of ADaaS snap-in to bring the data to DevRev or load the data to the external system.

A forward sync run is a sync from an external system to DevRev. An extractor is used to extract the created and/or
updated data from the external system, such as Jira, Zendesk or HubSpot to DevRev. An extractor function
in the snap-in is responsible for extracting data from the external system. It uses standardized communication protocol
for talking to [Airdrop](https://docs.devrev.ai/import#airdrop-features) and a standardized data structure for all the files
it extracts and processes, so that they can be transformed, deduplicated and seamlessly imported into DevRev.

A reverse sync run is a sync from DevRev to an external system. It uses a loader function, to create and/or update data
in the external system.
