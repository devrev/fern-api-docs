In the attachment extraction phase, the snap-in has to upload each attachment to DevRev and associate it with its parent data object.

## Triggering event

Airdrop initiates the attachment extraction by starting the snap-in with a message with an event of
type `EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_START`.
This is done after the data extraction, transformation, and loading into DevRev are completed.

During the attachment extraction phase,
the snap-in extracts attachments from the external system and uploads them as artifacts to DevRev.

The snap-in must respond to Airdrop with a message with an event of type
`EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_PROGRESS` together with an optional progress estimate
when the maximum snap-in runtime (13 minutes) has been reached.

The snap-in must respond to Airdrop with a message with an event of type `EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_DELAY`
and specify a back-off time when the extraction has been rate-limited by the external system and
back-off is required.

In both cases, Airdrop starts the snap-in with a message with an event of type
`EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_CONTINUE`.
The restart is immediate in case of `EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_PROGRESS`, or delayed in case of
`EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_DELAY`.

Once the attachment extraction phase is done, the snap-in must respond to Airdrop with a message
with an event of type `EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_DONE`.

If attachment extraction fails the snap-in must respond to Airdrop with a message with an event of
type `EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_ERROR`.

## Implementation

Attachments extraction is already provided by SDK, but if you need to customize it for your use case,
it should be implemented in the [attachments-extraction.ts](https://github.com/devrev/airdrop-template/blob/main/code/src/functions/extraction/workers/attachments-extraction.ts) file.

After uploading an attachment or a batch of attachments, the extractor also has to prepare and
upload a file specifying the extracted and uploaded attachments.

It should contain the DevRev IDs of the extracted and uploaded attachments, along with the parent
domain object ID from the external system and the actor ID from the external system.

The uploaded artifact is structured like a normal artifact containing extracted data in JSON Lines
(JSONL) format and requires specifying `ssor_attachment` as the item type.

The snap-in must respond to Airdrop with a message, that either signals success:

```typescript
await adapter.emit(ExtractorEventType.ExtractionAttachmentsDone);
```

a delay:

```typescript
await adapter.emit(ExtractorEventType.ExtractionAttachmentsDelay, {
  delay: "30",
});
```

or an error:

```typescript
await adapter.emit(ExtractorEventType.ExtractionAttachmentsError, {
  error: "Informative error message",
});
```

**The snap-in must always emit a single message.**

## Examples

Here is an example of an SSOR attachment file:

```json lines
{
  "id": {
    "devrev": "don:core:dvrv-us-1:devo/1:artifact/1", // DON of the artifact, that S3interact returned
    "external": "111" // ID of the artifact in the external service
  },
  "parent_id": {
    "external": "1111" // ID of the parent object in the external service
  },
  "actor_id": {
    "external": "11111" // ID of the actor that uploaded/modified the artifact in the external service
  }
}
{
  "id": {
    "devrev": "don:core:dvrv-us-1:devo/1:artifact/2",
    "external": "222"
  },
  "parent_id": {
    "external": "2222"
  },
  "actor_id": {
    "external": "22222"
  }
}
```
