TODO: Keyring explanation and guide setting up.

## Keyrings

_Keyrings_ are a DevRev-specific mechanism for managing authentication to external systems.
They are called **Connections** in the DevRev app.

Keyrings provide a secure way to store and manage credentials within your DevRev snap-in.
This eliminates the need to expose sensitive information like passwords or access tokens directly
within your code or configuration files, enhancing overall security.
They also provide a valid token by abstracting OAuth token renewal from the end user.

A keyring is used by a worker to authenticate to the external system in API calls.
They include the key (for example, a PAT or API key), its type, the organization ID for which a
key is valid, and in some cases the organization name.

Configure a keyring for the external system in the `manifest.yaml`.
Refer to [Keyrings](/snapin-development/references/manifest#developer-keyrings) for instructions.
