## Keyrings

_Keyrings_ are a collection of authentication information, used by a snap-in to authenticate to the external system in API calls. This can include a key (e.g., a PAT token or API key), its type, the organization ID for which a key is valid, and in some cases the organization name.

Keyrings provide a secure way to store and manage credentials within your DevRev snap-in.
This eliminates the need to expose sensitive information like passwords or access tokens directly
within your code or configuration files, enhancing overall security.
They also provide a valid token by abstracting OAuth token renewal from the end user.

They are called **Connections** in the DevRev app.

### Configure a keyring

Keyrings are configured in the `manifest.yaml` by configuring a `keyring_type`, like in the [example](https://github.com/devrev/adaas-template/blob/main/manifest.yaml).

```yaml
keyring_types:
  - id: <id of the keyring type>
    name: <name of the keyring type>
    description: <description of the keyring type>
    # The kind field specifies the type of keyring.
    kind: <"secret"/"oauth2">
    # is_subdomain field specifies whether the keyring contains a subdomain.
    # Enabling this field allows the keyring to get the subdomain from the user during creation.
    # This is useful when the keyring requires a subdomain as part of the configuration.
    # Default is false.
    is_subdomain: <true/false>
    # Name of the external system you are importing from.
    # This system name should start with a capital letter.
    external_system_name: <External system name>
    secret_config:
      # Define the fields in the secret.
      # Each element represents one input field.
      # User will provide this information when creating the connection in the UI.
      # If omitted, the user will be asked for a generic secret.
      fields:
        - id: <field_id>
          name: <field_name>
          description: <field_description>
          is_optional: <true/false> # optional: whether the field is optional or not. Default is false.
      # The token_verification section is used to verify the token provided by the user.
      token_verification:
        # The URL to which the token will be sent for verification.
        url: <url>
        # The HTTP method to be used for the verification request.
        method: <method> # The HTTP method to be used for the verification request.
        # Optional: headers to be included in the verification request.
        headers:
          <header_name>: <header_value>
        # Optional: query parameters to be included in the verification request.
        query_params:
          <param_name>: <param_value> # optional: query parameters to be included in the verification request.
      # Fetching Organization Data: This allows you to retrieve additional information about the user's organization.
      organization_data:
        type: "config"
        # The URL to which the request is sent to fetch organization data.
        url: <url>
        # The HTTP method used to send the request.
        method: "GET"
        headers:
          <header_name>: <header_value>
        # The jq filter used to extract the organization data from the response.
        response_jq: <jq_filter>
```
