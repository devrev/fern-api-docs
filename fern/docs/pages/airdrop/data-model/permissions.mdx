DevRev uses the concept of permissions to control access to records. 
Permissions are associated with users or groups and define the level of access they have to leaf types and their fields.

## Article permissions

{/* TODO: more on article permissions */}
Articles can be shared with users or groups. 

The `shared_with` field allows to specify the permission level for each user or group using the `permission` type. 
The `permission` type is a special structure associating a reference to an user-like record type (the field `member_id`)
with an `enum` value that provides the user with the role or permission level.

## Platform Groups

Platform groups are groups automatically created by the DevRev platform for every organization. 
For example, DevRev provides *Dev users* and *Rev users* groups that contain all the Dev and Rev users respectively.

We allow developers to map their external default groups to platform groups. 
This functionality allows for flexible integration with the platform's permission system while allowing for re-mapping by the end user. 

### Implementation Guide

1. Developers need to create a mapping between their external default groups and the platform's 
internal default groups using a new mapping object. 
   - To do this define a new object in external metadata. 
   - The object should have one enum field with the possible values being the default groups available in external system.  
2. Developers can use initial domain mapping to map their object to the *platform groups* object in devrev.
3. The platform groups object can be referenced in other objects, for example in the `shared_with` field of articles.
