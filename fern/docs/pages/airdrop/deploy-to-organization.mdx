Once you're ready to test your snap-in in a production environment, you can deploy the snap-in to your organization.

Follow these steps:

1. Copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env` and fill in the required variables.
2. Deploy a draft version of your snap-in to your organization by using `make deploy`.
3. Install the snap-in by going to **Settings** > **Snap-ins** > **Install snap-in** or by running `devrev snap_in activate`.
4. Start an import by clicking the **Start Airdrop** button in the top right corner.

This step is also a prerequisite for publishing the snap-in on the DevRev marketplace.

### Observability

To observe logs from your snap-in in your development environment:

```bash
devrev snap_in_package logs | jq
```

To open logs in your favorite editor:

```bash
devrev snap_in_package logs | code -
```

For more information, refer to [Debugging](/snapin-development/debugging).

### Uninstall

When you need to remove your snap-in from the organization, you can use the uninstall command to delete the most recently deployed snap-in package and version.

Run the following command from the root directory of your snap-in:

```bash
make uninstall
```
