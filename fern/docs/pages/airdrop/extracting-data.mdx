Data extraction involves four sequential phases:

1. external sync units extraction (only on initial import),
2. metadata extraction,
3. data extraction,
4. attachments extraction.

### Before you start implementation

It is recommended you consider the following points before you start the implementation:

1. Examine the available objects in both the external system and DevRev and decide how they should correspond to each other.
2. Identify required fields in DevRev and available fields in the external system API. Plan mappings accordingly, considering how to handle required fields in one system that are optional in the other.
3. Check the external system API too see what are options and limitations.
