Extraction generally involves four sequential phases:

1. external sync units extraction (only on initial import),
2. metadata extraction,
3. data extraction,
4. attachments extraction.

### Before you start implementation

It is recommended you consider the following points before you start the implementation:

1. Examine the domain model of the external system and identify available and required fields for its objects.
2. Examine DevRev's domain model - use the specification given [here](https://github.com/devrev/airdrop-recipe-manager/blob/main/v2/devrev_metadata/devrev_metadata_docs.md).
3. Decide how objects should correspond to each other and plan field mappings accordingly. Consider how to handle required fields in one system that are optional in the other.
4. Check the external system API too see what are options and limitations.
