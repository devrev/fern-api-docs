Airdrop extractions are done in _sync runs_.
A sync run is one execution of an import or sync.
If you do an initial import from the external system to DevRev, that import will be one sync run.
If you then decide to do a reverse sync from DevRev to the external system, that would be another
sync run.

Each sync run is comprised out of phases.
Phases follow sequentially, and each can consist of one or more invocations of the snap-in.

## Sync modes

### Initial import

An _initial import_ is the first import of data from the external system to DevRev.
It is triggered manually by the end user in DevRev's **Imports** UI.

An _initial import_ consists of the following phases:
1. External sync units extraction
2. Metadata extraction
3. Data extraction
4. Attachments extraction


### 1-way sync

A _1-way sync_ refers to any extraction after the initial import has been successfully completed.
An extractor extracts data that was created or updated in the external system after the start
of the latest successful forward sync, including any changes that occurred during the forward sync,
but were not picked up by it.

A snap-in must consult its state to get information on when the last successful forward sync started.
Airdrop snap-ins must maintain their own states that persists between phases in a sync run,
as well as between sync runs.

A 1-way sync consists of the following phases:
1. Metadata extraction
2. Data extraction
3. Attachments extraction

A 1-way sync extracts only the domain objects updated or created since the previous successful sync run.


### Deletion mode

A _deletion_ consists of the following phases:
1. Data deletion
2. Attachments deletion
