Each snap-in must handle all the phases of Airdrop extraction. In a snap-in, you typically define a run
function that iterates over events and invokes workers per extraction phase.

The SDK library exports `processTask` to structure the work within each phase, and `onTimeout` function
to handle timeouts.

The Airdrop snap-in extraction lifecycle consists of four phases: External Sync Units Extraction,
Metadata Extraction, Data Extraction and Attachments Extraction. Each phase is defined in a 
separate file and is responsible for fetching the respective data.

The SDK library provides a repository management system to handle artifacts in batches.
The `initializeRepos` function initializes the repositories, and the `push` function uploads the
artifacts to the repositories. The `postState` function is used to post the state of the extraction task.

State management is crucial for snap-ins to maintain the state of the extraction task.
The `postState` function is used to post the state of the extraction task.
The state is stored in the adapter and can be retrieved using the `adapter.state` property.

```typescript
import { AirdropEvent, EventType, spawn } from "@devrev/ts-adaas";

export interface ExtractorState {
  todos: { completed: boolean };
  users: { completed: boolean };
  attachments: { completed: boolean };
}

export const initialState: ExtractorState = {
  todos: { completed: false },
  users: { completed: false },
  attachments: { completed: false },
};

function getWorkerPerExtractionPhase(event: AirdropEvent) {
  let path;
  switch (event.payload.event_type) {
    case EventType.ExtractionExternalSyncUnitsStart:
      path = __dirname + '/workers/external-sync-units-extraction';
      break;
    case EventType.ExtractionMetadataStart:
      path = __dirname + '/workers/metadata-extraction';
      break;
    case EventType.ExtractionDataStart:
    case EventType.ExtractionDataContinue:
      path = __dirname + '/workers/data-extraction';
      break;
    case EventType.ExtractionAttachmentsStart:
    case EventType.ExtractionAttachmentsContinue:
      path = __dirname + '/workers/attachments-extraction';
      break;
  }
  return path;
}

const run = async (events: AirdropEvent[]) => {
  for (const event of events) {
    const file = getWorkerPerExtractionPhase(event);
    await spawn<ExtractorState>({
      event,
      initialState,
      workerPath: file,

      // TODO: If needed you can pass additional options to the spawn function.
      // For example timeout of the lambda, batch size, etc.
      // options: {},
    });
  }
};

export default run;
```
