Each snap-in must handle all the phases of Airdrop extraction. In a snap-in, you typically define a run
function that iterates over events and invokes workers per extraction phase.

The SDK library exports `processTask` to structure the work within each phase, and `onTimeout` function
to handle timeouts.

The snap-in extraction lifecycle consists of three main phases: External Sync Units Extraction,
Metadata Extraction, and Data Extraction. Each phase is defined in a separate file and is responsible
for fetching the respective data.

The SDK library provides a repository management system to handle artifacts in batches.
The `initializeRepos` function initializes the repositories, and the `push` function uploads the
artifacts to the repositories. The `postState` function is used to post the state of the extraction task.

State management is crucial for snap-ins to maintain the state of the extraction task.
The `postState` function is used to post the state of the extraction task.
The state is stored in the adapter and can be retrieved using the `adapter.state` property.

```typescript
import { AirdropEvent, EventType, spawn } from "@devrev/ts-adaas";

interface DummyExtractorState {
  issues: { completed: boolean };
  users: { completed: boolean };
  attachments: { completed: boolean };
}

const initialState: DummyExtractorState = {
  issues: { completed: false },
  users: { completed: false },
  attachments: { completed: false },
};

function getWorkerPerExtractionPhase(event: AirdropEvent) {
  let path;
  switch (event.payload.event_type) {
    case EventType.ExtractionExternalSyncUnitsStart:
      path = __dirname + "/workers/external-sync-units-extraction";
      break;
    case EventType.ExtractionMetadataStart:
      path = __dirname + "/workers/metadata-extraction";
      break;
    case EventType.ExtractionDataStart:
    case EventType.ExtractionDataContinue:
      path = __dirname + "/workers/data-extraction";
      break;
  }
  return path;
}

const run = async (events: AirdropEvent[]) => {
  for (const event of events) {
    const file = getWorkerPerExtractionPhase(event);
    await spawn<DummyExtractorState>({
      event,
      initialState,
      workerPath: file,
      options: {
        isLocalDevelopment: true,
      },
    });
  }
};

export default run;
```
