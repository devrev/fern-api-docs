## Airdrop template repository

#### I'm getting a `Conflict` error after the `Creating snap-in package...` message when running `make deploy`

> A snap-in package with the same slug already exists.
Override the ``SNAP_IN_SLUG`` variable by explicitly updating the variable in `scripts/vars.sh`.

#### Deployment or building of a snap-in version failed after the `Waiting for snap-in version to be ready...` message

> The snap-in version could not be built.
> Check the logs by running the DevRev CLI command. For prettier UI, pipe the output to `jq`.
> ```
> devrev snap_in_package logs | jq

## Token handling

#### `Token is expired` when deploying or cleaning up

> Authentication token to the `DEV_ORG` has expired. Reauthenticate the organization by running.
