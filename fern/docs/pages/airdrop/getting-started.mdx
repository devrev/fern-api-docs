## Before you begin

### Create a new organization

If this is your first time setting up an organization within DevRev, you'll need to create a dedicated DevRev organization for developing your new Airdrop snap-in:

1. Click on your profile picture in the top left corner.
2. Go to the **Orgs** section and click on **+**.
3. Fill in the necessary details and click **Create**.

You now find your newly created organization under **Orgs**.

### Install required tools and packages

- [devrev-cli](https://developer.devrev.ai/snapin-development/references/cli-install) (version 4.7 or higher)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq)
- [golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) (version 18.x.x+ or higher)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com)

## Setting up the snap-in

### Starter template

DevRev provides a starter template for Airdrop snap-in development.

1. Create a new repository from [Airdrop template repository](https://github.com/devrev/adaas-template) by selecting _Use this template_ and then _Create a new repository_.
2. Copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env` and fill in the required variables.

### Local development

For ease of development, you can run your snap-in locally and receive logs directly in your console. Follow the guide [here](/snapin-development/locally-testing-snap-ins).

### Publishing the snap-in

Once you're ready to launch your snap-in in a production environment, follow these steps:

1. Deploy a draft version of your snap-in to your organization by using `make deploy`.
2. Install the snap-in in your DevRev by going to **Settings** > **Snap-ins** > **Install snap-in**.
3. Set up the connection under **Settings** > **Airdrops** > **Connections**.
4. Create an import at **Settings** > **Airdrops** > **Airdrop**.

#### Observability

To observe logs from your snap-in in your development environment:

```
devrev snap_in_package logs | jq
```

To open logs in your favorite editor:

```
devrev snap_in_package logs | code -
```
