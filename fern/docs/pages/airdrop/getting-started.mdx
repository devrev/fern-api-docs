## DevRev organization

If this is your first time setting up an organization within DevRev, you need to create a DevRev organization for developing your new Airdrop snap-in:

1. Click on your profile picture in the top left corner.
2. Go to the **Orgs** section and click on **+**.
3. Fill in the necessary details and click **Create**.

You now find your newly created organization under **Orgs**.

## External system

Before starting the development of a snap-in for integration with an external system API, consider gathering the following information:

- API Documentation: Obtain the official API documentation of the external system. This will be the primary source of information about how to connect and interact with the system.
- Authentication and Authorization: Understand the authentication and authorization methods required. This may include API keys, OAuth tokens, or other security mechanisms.
- Endpoints and Resources: Identify the required API endpoints and resources. Understand their functions, input parameters, expected outputs, and usage limitations.
- Data Format: Determine the data format used by the API, such as JSON or XML. This helps in parsing responses and formatting requests appropriately.
- Rate Limits and Quotas: Be aware of any rate limits or usage quotas. This information is crucial to ensure that the integration does not exceed allowed requests or data usage.
- Error Handling: Learn about error response formats and codes. Knowing this will help in effectively handling errors and exceptions in your integration.

## Terminology

### Sync run

Airdrop extractions are done in _sync runs_.
A sync run is one execution of an airdrop or sync.

### Forward sync

A _forward sync_ is a sync run from an external system to DevRev.
An **extractor** function in the snap-in is responsible for extracting data from the external system.

### Reverse sync

A _reverse sync_ is a sync run from DevRev to an external system.
It uses a **loader** function, to create or update data in the external system.

### Initial sync

It is the first forward sync to run. In initial sync all data needs to be extracted to create a baseline (while in incremental runs only updated objects need to be extracted).

### 1-way (incremental) sync

A _1-way sync_ (or _incremental sync_) refers to any extraction after the initial sync run has been successfully completed.
In the incremental sync an extractor extracts data that was created or updated in the external system after the start
of the latest successful forward sync, including any changes that occurred during the forward sync,
but were not picked up by it.

### Sync unit

A _sync unit_ is one connection instance to an external system (for example SalesForce, Freshdesk, Zendesk).
