In the load attachments phase, the snap-in saves each attachment to the external system.

## Triggering event

Airdrop initiates the load attachments phase by starting the snap-in with a message containing an event of type `START_LOADING_ATTACHMENTS`.

## Implementation

This phase is defined in [load-attachments.ts](https://github.com/devrev/airdrop-template/blob/main/code/src/functions/loading/workers/load-attachments.ts). 

The loading process involves providing the `create` function to add attachments to the external system. The `create` function is responsible for making API calls to the external system to create the attachments, as well as handling errors and the external system's rate limiting. The function returns the ID and modified date of the record in the external system or indicates a rate-limiting back-off or logs errors if the attachment could not be created.

```typescript
processTask<LoaderState>({
  task: async ({ adapter }) => {
    const { reports, processed_files } = await adapter.loadAttachments({
      create: createAttachment,
    });

    await adapter.emit(LoaderEventType.AttachmentLoadingDone, {
      reports,
      processed_files,
    });
  },
  onTimeout: async ({ adapter }) => {
    await adapter.emit(LoaderEventType.AttachmentLoadingProgress, {
      reports: adapter.reports,
      processed_files: adapter.processedFiles,
    });
  },
});
```
