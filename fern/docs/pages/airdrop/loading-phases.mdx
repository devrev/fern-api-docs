Loading is the process of exporting data from DevRev back to the external system.
This process includes creating new items in the external system and updating them with any changes made in DevRev.

The snap-in manages two phases for loading:
* Load data
* Load attachments

Each phase is defined in a separate file and is responsible for loading the corresponding data.

```typescript
import { AirdropEvent, EventType, spawn } from '@devrev/ts-adaas';

export interface LoaderState {}

export const initialLoaderState: LoaderState = {};

function getWorkerPerLoadingPhase(event: AirdropEvent) {
  let path;
  switch (event.payload.event_type) {
    case EventType.StartLoadingData:
    case EventType.ContinueLoadingData:
      path = __dirname + '/workers/load-data';
      break;
    case EventType.StartLoadingAttachments:
    case EventType.ContinueLoadingAttachments:
      path = __dirname + '/workers/load-attachments';
      break;
  }
  return path;
}

const run = async (events: AirdropEvent[]) => {
  for (const event of events) {
    const file = getWorkerPerLoadingPhase(event);
    await spawn<LoaderState>({
      event,
      initialState: initialLoaderState,
      workerPath: file,
      // options: {},
    });
  }
};

export default run;
```

## State handling

Loading phases run as separate runtime instances, similar to extraction phases, with a maximum execution time of 12 minutes. 
These phases share a `state`, defined in the `LoaderState` interface. 
It is important to note that the loader state is separate from the extractor state. 
Access to the `state` is available through the SDK's `adapter` object.
