During the metadata extraction phase, the snap-in must provide an
`external_domain_metadata.json` file to Airdrop.
This file provides a structured way of describing the external system's domain system,
including its domain entities, types, relationships, and other metadata.

## Triggering event

Airdrop initiates the metadata extraction by starting the snap-in with a message with an event
of type `ExtractionMetadataStart`.

The snap-in must respond to Airdrop with a message with an event of type `ExtractionMetadataDone`
when done, or `ExtractionMetadataError` in case of an error.

## Response from the snap-in

Metadata extraction should be implemented in the [metadata-extraction.ts](https://github.com/devrev/adaas-template/blob/main/code/src/functions/extraction/workers/metadata-extraction.ts) file.

```typescript
import externalDomainMetadata from "../../external-system/external_domain_metadata.json";

// ...

await adapter
  .getRepo("external_domain_metadata")
  ?.push([externalDomainMetadata]);
await adapter.emit(ExtractorEventType.ExtractionMetadataDone);
```
