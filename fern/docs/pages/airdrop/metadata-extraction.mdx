During the metadata extraction phase, the Airdrop snap-in must provide an
`external_domain_metadata.json` file on each sync run.
This file provides a structured way of describing the external system's domain system,
including its domain entities, types, relationships, and other metadata.

The extraction function of the snap-in must provide a valid metadata file.
DevRev provides a JSON schema and a CLI tool [chef-cli](https://github.com/devrev/adaas-chef-cli)
to validate the proposed schema.

## Triggering event

Airdrop initiates the metadata extraction by starting the snap-in with a message with an event
of type `EXTRACTION_METADATA_START`.

The snap-in must respond to Airdrop with a message with an event of type `EXTRACTION_METADATA_DONE`
when done, or `EXTRACTION_METADATA_ERROR` in case of an error.

## Response from the snap-in

During the metadata extraction phase, the Airdrop snap-in must provide an
`external_domain_metadata.json` file on each sync run.

The transformation can be crafted and finalized further using the `chef-cli` to ensure extracted
data is mapped consistently to the DevRev domain model.

## Getting started with infer-metadata

The `chef-cli` provides a helpful command to generate initial domain metadata from example data:

```bash
chef-cli infer-metadata example_data_directory > metadata.json
```

To get good results with this approach:

1. Collect example data from the external system and place them in a directory. Each file should:
   - Contain the same type of records, named after their type
   - Have .json or .jsonl extension, for example `issues.json`
   - Contain either a single JSON array of objects, or newline-separated objects

2. Run the `infer-metadata` command targeting this directory

3. Inspect the generated metadata, particularly field types and the suggestions the tool generates

For best results:
- Provide 10-100 examples of each record type (but not more than 1000)
- Ensure logically distinct fields are separate keys at the top level
- Use referentially consistent example data if possible
- Make sure IDs are strings, not numbers

This generated metadata serves as a starting point that will need further refinement.

## Craft the metadata declaration

Since crafting metadata declaration in the form of an `external_domain_metadata.json` file can be a
tedious process, a step-by-step approach is useful for understanding the metadata declarations and
as a checklist to declare the metadata for an extraction from a specific external system.

Metadata declarations include both _static declarations_, formulated by deduction and comparison of
external domain system, and DevRev domain system and _dynamic declarations_ that are obtained during
a snap-in run from external system APIs (since they are configurable in the external system and can
be changed by the end user at any time, such as mandatory fields or custom fields).

<Steps>
  ### Declare the extracted record types

    _Record types_ are the types of records that has a well-defined schema you extract from or load
    to the external system, a domain object in the external system.

    If the snap-in is extracting issues and comments, a good starting point to declare record types
    in `external_domain_metadata.json` would be:

    ```json
    {
      "record_types": {
        "issues": {},
        "comments": {}
      }
    }
    ```
    Although the declaration of record types is arbitrary, they must match the `item_type`
    field in the artifacts you will upload.

  ### Declare the custom record types

    If the external system supports custom types, or custom variants of some base record type,
    and you want to airdrop those too, you have to declare them in the metadata at runtime.
    That is, the extractor will use APIs of the external system to dynamically discover what
    custom record types exist.

    The output of this process might look like this:

    ```json
    {
    "record_types": {
        "issues_stock_epic": {},
        "issues_custom2321": {},
        "issues_custom2322": {},
        "comments": {}
      }
    }
    ```

  ### Provide human-readable names to external record types

    Define human-readable names for the record types defined in your metadata file.

    ```json
      {
      "record_types":{
        "issues_stock_epic":{
          "name":"Epic"
        },
        "issues_custom2321":{
          "name":"Incident report"
        },
        "issues_custom2322":{
          "name":"Problem"
        },
        "comments":{
          "name":"Comment"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  ### Categorize external record types

    The metadata allows each external record type to be annotated with one category.
    The category key can be an arbitrary string, but it must match the categories declared under
    `record_type_categories`.

    Categories of external record types simplify mappings so that a mapping can be applied to a
    whole category of record types.
    Categories also provide a way how custom record types can be mapped.

    If the external system allows records to change the record type within the category,
    while still preserving identity, this can be defined by the `are_record_type_conversions_possible`
    field in the `record_type_categories` section. For example, if an issue that can be moved to
    become a problem in the external system.

    ```json
    {
      "record_types":{
        "issues_stock_epic":{
          "name":"Epic",
          "category":"issue"
        },
        "issues_custom2321":{
          "name":"Incident report",
          "category":"issue"
        },
        "issues_custom2322":{
          "name":"Problem",
          "category":"issue"
        },
        "comments":{
          "name":"Comment"
        }
      },
      "record_type_categories":{
        "issue":{
          "are_record_type_conversions_possible":true
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  ### Declare fields for each record type

    Fields' keys must match what is actually found in the extracted data in the artifacts.

    The supported types are:
    - `bool`
    - `int`
    - `float`
    - `text`
    - `rich_text`: Formatted text with mentions and images.
    - `reference`: IDs referring to another record. References have to declare what they can refer
    to, which can be one or more record types (`#record:`) or categories (`#category:`).
    - `enum`: A string from a predefined set of values with the optional human-readable names for each value.
    - `date`
    - `timestamp`
    - `struct`

    If the external system supports custom fields, the set of custom fields in each record type
    you wish to extract must be declared too.

    Enum fields' set of possible values can often be customizable.
    A good practice is to retrieve the set of possible values for all enum fields from the external
    system's APIs in each sync run.

    `ID` (primary key) of the record, `created_date`, and `modified_date` must not be declared.

    Example:

    ```json
    {
      "record_types": {
        "issues_stock_epic": {
          "name": "Epic",
          "category": "issue",
          "fields": {
            "actual_close_date": {
              "name": "Closed at",
              "type": "timestamp"
            },
            "owner": {
              "is_required": true,
              "type": "reference",
              "reference": {
                "refers_to": {
                  "#record:user": {}
                }
              }
            },
            "creator": {
              "is_required": true,
              "type": "reference",
              "reference": {
                "refers_to": {
                  "#record:user": {}
                }
              }
            },
            "priority": {
              "name": "Priority",
              "is_required": true,
              "type": "enum",
              "enum": {
                "values": [
                  {
                    "key": "P-0",
                    "name": "Super important"
                  },
                  {
                    "key": "P-1"
                  },
                  {
                    "key": "P-2"
                  }
                ]
              }
            },
            "target_close_date": {
              "type": "date"
            },
            "headline": {
              "name": "Headline",
              "is_required": true,
              "type": "text"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  ### Declare arrays

    If the field is array in the extracted data, it is still typed with the one of the supported types.
    Lists must be marked as a `collection`.

    ``` json
    {
      "name": "Assignees",
      "is_required": true,
      "type": "reference",
      "reference": {
        "refers_to": {
          "#category:agents": {}
        }
      },
      "collection": {
        "max_length": 5
      }
    }
    ```

  ### Handle special references

  - Some references have role of parent or child.
  This means that the child record doesn't make sense without its parent, for example a comment
  attached to a ticket.
  Assigning a `reference_type` helps Airdrop correctly handle such fields in case the end-user
  decides to filter some of the parent records out.

  - Sometimes the external system uses references besides the primary key of records, for example
  when referring to a case by serial number, or to a user by their email.
  To correctly resolve such references, they must be marked with 'by_field', which must be a field
  existing in that record type, marked 'is_identifier'. For example:
  ```json
  {
    "record_types": {
      "users": {
        "fields": {
          "email": {
            "type": "text",
            "is_identifier":true
          }
        }
      },
      "comments": {
        "fields": {
          "user_email": {
            "type": "reference",
            "reference": {
              "refers_to": {
                "#record:users": {
                  "by_field": "email"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Define field attributes

  External system fields that shouldn't be mapped in reverse should be marked as `is_read_only`. 
  Depending on their purpose you can also mark fields as `is_indexed`, `is_identifier`, `is_filterable`, 
  `is_write_only` etc. By default these will be set to false. You can find the full list of supported 
  field attributes and their descriptions in the [metadata schema](./external_domain_metadata_schema.json).

  ### Configure state transitions

  If an external record type has some concept of states, between which only certain transitions are 
  possible (e.g., to move to the 'resolved' status, an issue first has to be 'in_testing'), you 
  can declare these in the metadata too.

  This will allow creation of a matching 'stage diagram' in DevRev, which enables a much simpler 
  import and a closer preservation of the external data than mapping to DevRev's builtin stages.

  This is especially important for two-way sync, as setting the transitions correctly ensures that 
  the transitions a record undergoes in DevRev can be replicated in the external system.

  To declare this in the metadata, make sure the status is represented as an enum field, and then 
  declare the allowed transitions:

  ```json
  {
    "fields": {
      "status": {
        "name": "Status",
        "is_required": true,
        "type": "enum",
        "enum": {
          "values": [
            {
              "key": "detected",
              "name": "Detected"
            },
            {
              "key": "mitigated",
              "name": "Mitigated"
            },
            {
              "key": "rca_ready",
              "name": "RCA Ready"
            },
            {
              "key": "archived",
              "name": "Archived"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    "stage_diagram": {
      "controlling_field": "status",
      "starting_stage": "detected",
      "all_transitions_allowed": false,
      "stages": {
        "detected": {
          "transitions_to": ["mitigated", "archived", "rca_ready"],
          "state": "new"
        },
        "mitigated": {
          "transitions_to": ["archived", "detected"],
          "state": "work_in_progress"
        },
        "rca_ready": {
          "transitions_to": ["archived"],
          "state": "work_in_progress"
        },
        "archived": {
          "transitions_to": [],
          "state": "completed"
        }
      },
      "states": {
        "new": {
          "name": "New"
        },
        "work_in_progress": {
          "name": "Work in Progress"
        },
        "completed": {
          "name": "Completed",
          "is_end_state": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  In the above example:
  - The status field is the controlling field of the stage diagram
  - If a status field has no explicit transitions but you still want a stage diagram, set `all_transitions_allowed` to `true`
  - External systems may categorize statuses (like Jira's status categories), which can be included in the diagram metadata (`states` in the example)
  - The `starting_stage` defines the initial stage for new object instances
  - In current metadata format (v0.2.0), the order and human-readable name are taken from the enum values defined on the controlling field
</Steps>
