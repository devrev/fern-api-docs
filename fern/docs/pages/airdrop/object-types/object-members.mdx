Object members define which users belong to which groups.

They consist of the following fields:
- `id`: The unique identifier for the object member in the external system
- `object_id`: The unique identifier for the group in the external system
- `member_id`: The unique identifier for the user that should be added to the group
- `add_member_ids`: The list of unique identifiers for the users that should be added to the group
- `remove_member_ids`: The list of unique identifiers for the users that should be removed from the group

<Warning>
If you set the `add_member_ids` field, the `member_id` field will be ignored!
Always set either `add_member_ids` or `member_id`, but not both.
</Warning>

<Info>
`member_id` is a legacy field that, while still supported, should be avoided in favor of `add_member_ids`.
If possible, provide one object member per group, with the list of users to be added to the group.
Originally each object member was used to add a single user to a group, but that has since been
extended to support bulk addition and removal of users from a group.
</Info>

<Info>
If the external system exposes a way to notify you of user removals from a group, set those users
in the `remove_member_ids` field.
