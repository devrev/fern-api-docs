_Airdrop_ is DevRev’s solution to migrate data. It allows our customers to bring in their existing
data from external systems to DevRev, export data back to external systems, and keep data in sync
between DevRev and the external systems.

DevRev provides a range of snap-ins available through the DevRev marketplace for integration with various external systems like Jira and Zendesk. Sometimes, a specific snap-in may not be available for certain external systems. This is where Airdrop's enhanced functionality comes in, allowing developers to integrate with DevRev’s Airdrop. It enables the creation of external workers (extractors and loaders) to facilitate data transfer from different external systems.

You can learn more about Airdrop in the [general documentation](https://docs.devrev.ai/import#airdrop-features).
