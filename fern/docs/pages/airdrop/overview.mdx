_Airdrop_ is DevRev’s solution to migrate data. It allows our customers to bring in their existing
data from external systems to DevRev, export data back to external systems, and keep data in sync
between DevRev and the external systems.

DevRev is extending Airdrop's capabilities to give snap-in developers the ability to integrate with
DevRev’s Airdrop functionality.
It enables developers to create external workers (extractors and loaders) to bring data from various
external systems.

You can learn more about Airdrop in the [general documentation](https://docs.devrev.ai/import#airdrop-features).
