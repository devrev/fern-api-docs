_Airdrop_ is DevRev’s solution to migrate data. It allows our customers to bring in their existing
data from external systems to DevRev, export data back to external systems, and keep data in sync
between DevRev and the external systems.

DevRev provides a range of snap-ins available through the DevRev marketplace for integration with
various external systems like Jira and Zendesk. Sometimes, a specific snap-in may not be available
for a given external system. This is why DevRev enables creation of external workers (extractors
and loaders) to other developers, allowing them to integrate with DevRev’s Airdrop and develop their own snap-ins.

You can learn more about Airdrop in the [general documentation](https://docs.devrev.ai/import#airdrop-features).
