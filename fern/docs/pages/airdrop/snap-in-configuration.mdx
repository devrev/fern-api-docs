Development of a snap-in starts with a `manifest.yaml`.
Manifest holds a snap-in configuration: snap-in name, description, version, connection information and information about implemented functionality.

Begin by setting the values in the template for `name` and `description`.

```yaml
name: ADaaS Template
description: A template for creating a new ADaaS snap-in
```

### Set snap-in functionalities

The DevRev platform enables the creation of a snap-in that can import data from an external system into DevRev (called _extraction_) and export data from DevRev to an external system (called _loading_). Implementation of extration is necessary, while of loading isn't.

To specify the implemented functionalities, first review the `functions` section of `manifest.yaml`.

```yaml
functions:
  - name: extraction
    description: Extraction function for the template snap-in
  - name: loading
    description: Loading function for the template snap-in
  - name: install_initial_domain_mapping
    description: Create blueprint and install initial domain mapping
```

In case you're not going to implement loading, remove it from the list. This will also remove this option from the UI.

Next, check the `imports` section.

```yaml
imports:
  - slug: adaas-template
    display_name: ADaaS Connector Template
    description: ADaaS Connector Template
    extractor_function: extraction
    loader_function: loading
    allowed_connection_types:
      - example-connection
```

Change `slug`, `display_name` and `description` according to your snap-in.

Remove `loader_function` in case you're not using it.

Make sure the names for `extractor_function` and `loader_function` match your settings in the `functions` section.

When you are done you can continue with the next section that focuses on establishing a connection to the external system using `keyring_types`.
