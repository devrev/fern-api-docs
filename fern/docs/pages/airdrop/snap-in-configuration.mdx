## Setting up the snap-in configuration

Development of a snap-in starts with a `manifest.yaml`.
Manifest holds a snap-in configuration: snap-in name, description, version, connection information and information about implemented functionality.

In the template change values for

- `name`
- `description`

## Snap-in functionalities

This directory holds the snap-in's core logic. The logic for extracting data from the external system is found in the `extraction` folder, and the logic for loading data into the external system from DevRev is in the `loading` folder.

The DevRev platform enables the creation of a snap-in that can either import data from an external system into DevRev or export data from DevRev to an external system. Implementing both isn't necessary. The implemented functionalities are specified in `manifest.yaml` under the `functions` key, as shown in the starter template:

```yaml
functions:
  - name: extraction
    description: Extraction function for the template snap-in
  - name: loading
    description: Loading function for the template snap-in
  - name: install_initial_domain_mapping
    description: Create blueprint and install initial domain mapping
```

For example, removing the entry with the name loading means syncing from DevRev to the external system is not available in the UI.
