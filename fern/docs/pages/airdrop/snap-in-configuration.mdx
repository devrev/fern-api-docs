Start developing a snap-in with a `manifest.yaml` file. The manifest defines the snap-in's configuration, including its name, description, version, connection details, and functionality.

Begin by setting the values for `name` and `description` in the template.

```yaml
name: ADaaS Template
description: A template for creating a new ADaaS snap-in
```

### Set snap-in functionalities

DevRev supports creating snap-ins for importing data from an external system into DevRev (_extraction_) and exporting data from DevRev to an external system (_loading_). Implementing the extraction functionality is essential, while loading is optional.

To define the functionalities, review the `functions` section in the manifest.

```yaml
functions:
  - name: extraction
    description: Extraction function for the template snap-in
  - name: loading
    description: Loading function for the template snap-in
  - name: install_initial_domain_mapping
    description: Create blueprint and install initial domain mapping
```

If loading is not implemented, remove it from the list. This action also removes the option from the UI.

Check the `imports` section next.

```yaml
imports:
  - slug: adaas-template
    display_name: ADaaS Connector Template
    description: ADaaS Connector Template
    extractor_function: extraction
    loader_function: loading
    allowed_connection_types:
      - example-connection
```

Update the `slug`, `display_name`, and `description` to match your snap-in.

If loading is not used, remove `loader_function`.

Ensure that `extractor_function` and `loader_function` names correspond with those in the `functions` section.

Proceed to the next section, which dives in on establishing a connection to the external system using `keyring_types`.
