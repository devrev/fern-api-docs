For easier snap-in development, a starter template is available [here](https://github.com/devrev/adaas-template).

The template makes use of **DevRev's SDK library**, which helps developers build snap-ins that
integrate with DevRevâ€™s Airdrop platform. This library simplifies the workflow for handling
data extraction and loading, event-driven actions, state management, and artifact handling.

It provides features such as:

- **Type definitions**: Structured types for Airdrop control protocol.
- **Event management**: Communication between Airdrop and the snap-in involves messages called
  _events_ - depending on the type of event, the snap-in performs different actions.
- **State handling**: Update and access state in real-time within tasks.
- **Artifact management**: Supports batched storage of artifacts.
- **Error & timeout support**: Error handling and timeout management for long-running tasks.

### Snap-in code structure

If you check the template, you can see that a snap-in is a Node.js project with a specific file structure:

```
- manifest.yaml
- code/
  - scripts/
  - src/
    - fixtures/
    - functions/
      - external-system/
      - extraction/
        - workers/
          - attachments-extraction.ts
          - data-extraction.ts
          - external-sync-units-extraction.ts
          - metadata-extraction.ts
        - index.ts
      - install_initial_domain_mapping/
      - loading/
        - workers/
          - load-attachments.ts
          - load-data.ts
        - index.ts
    - test-runner/
  - test/
```

The `manifest.yaml` is a configuration file that defines details such as the snap-in's name, description, version, connection information, and functionality specifics. Adjusting this file is the initial step in the development of a snap-in.

The `code/` folder holds the implementation of the snap-in. Inside, the `functions/` subfolder includes the logic for retrieving external sync units, extracting data from and loading data to external systems, and mapping between them.

The `scripts/` folder contains the scripts necessary for the building and deployment of the snap-in, streamlining the development and deployment processes with the help of tools like `deploy.sh` and `build.sh`.
