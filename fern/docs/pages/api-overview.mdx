The DevRev API is built to allow you to integrate your apps, build automations, and create customÂ snap-ins. These are the APIs that power DevRev.

All of the DevRev APIs are organized around REST - if you've interacted with a RESTful API already, many of the concepts will be familiar to you. All API calls to DevRev should be made to the https://api.devrev.ai base domain. We use many standard HTTP features, like HTTP verbs, which can be understood by many HTTP clients. JSON will be returned in all responses, including errors. The APIs are designed to have predictable, straightforward URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors.

<Callout intent="Security: API key">
All the DevRev APIs require a token to authenticate the user. Provide `Authorization: <token>` as a header for every API request. [How do I find my token?](/welcome/about-the-dev-rev-api/authentication)

An API key is a token that you provide when making API calls. Include the token in a header parameter called Authorization.

Example: `Authorization: 123`
