The DevRev API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

You can use the DevRev API in test a demo organization which doesnâ€™t affect your live data or interact with your real customers. 

To create a new organization in DevRev:

1. Click on your profile picture on the top left corner. 
2. Go to the **Orgs** section and click on **+**.
3. Fill in the details and click **Create**.

![demo org](./img/demoorg.png)

Now you can find your newly created org in **Orgs**.

Login into your demo org and [obtain the PAT token](/about/authentication#generate-a-personal-access-token-pat). 
Now you can use this PAT token to make test API calls and try building something new.
