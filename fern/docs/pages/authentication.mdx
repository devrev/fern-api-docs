Authentication to DevRev APIs requires a personal access token (PAT). A PAT is used to uniquely identify a dev user in context of a dev org and can be used by external third-party applications to access DevRev APIs on behalf of the corresponding dev user. A PAT has the same set of privileges that the owner of the PAT has on the DevRev platform.

You can set the validity duration of a PAT. You can't renew a PAT; you can only create a new PAT and update your code to use it.

For example, a VS Code plugin that pulls issues from the DevRev platform pertaining to a particular dev user needs to rely on that userâ€™s PAT to authenticate the DevRev APIs.

If you are receiving an `invalid token` error, you can check whether the token is valid at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/).

## Generate a personal access token (PAT)

1. In the DevRev app, go to the relevant dev org.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Account** > **Personal Access Token**.
3. Click **New token** and follow the workflow to create your PAT.

As the token value isn't retrievable later, we recommend using descriptive names for PATs as it can help you differentiate between multiple PATs.

4. Copy the PAT and store it securely. Once you go to another page, you can't retrieve this PAT again.

## Revoke a personal access token

<Callout intent="warn">
 Once a PAT is revoked, it can't be restored.
</Callout>

1. In the DevRev app, go to the relevant dev org.
1. Go to **Settings** > **Account** > **Personal Access Token**.
1. Click **Revoke** next to the PAT you wish to revoke.

You can also click the **Revoke all** to revoke all the tokens which you have previously generated.
