Custom links allow you to create organization-specific relationships between any two objects in DevRev. 
This feature enables you to define meaningful connections with custom names that reflect your business processes.

This section provides an overview of custom links and walks you through the process of creating and managing them. 
By the end of this section, you'll be able to:
1. Define custom link types
2. Create links between objects
3. List custom link types
4. Update custom link types
5. Deprecate custom link types

## Concepts

### Custom link type

A custom link type defines a relationship between two types of objects. It specifies:
- The source object types that the link initiates from
- The target object types that the link can be created to
- A forward name describing the relationship from source to target
- A backward name describing the relationship from target to source

### Supported object types

Custom links can be created between the following object types:
- custom object
- issue, ticket, task, opportunity
- account, user
- part (product, capability, feature, enhancement)

For more details on customization or custom object concepts, please refer to the documentation below:
- [Customization](./object-customization)
- [Custom objects](./custom-objects)

## Create custom link types

<Callout intent="note">
Let's say you want to establish a parent-child relationship between tickets and a custom object 
type called "Campaign". This relationship helps track which tickets are assigned to which campaigns.
</Callout>

To create this relationship, make an API call to create a custom link type:

```curl
curl --location 'https://api.devrev.ai/link-types.custom.create' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' \
--data '{
    "name": "Link between ticket and campaign",
    "source_types": [
        {
            "leaf_type": "ticket"
        }
    ],
    "target_types": [
        {
            "leaf_type": "campaign",
            "is_custom_leaf_type": true
        }
    ],
    "forward_name": "is parent of",
    "backward_name": "is child of",
    "deprecated": false
}'
```

The custom link type above defines:
- A descriptive name
- Source types that the link can be created from (ticket)
- Target types that the link can be created to (campaign custom object)
- Forward name ("is parent of") describing the relationship from ticket to campaign
- Backward name ("is child of") describing the relationship from campaign to ticket

## Create links between objects

Once you have defined a custom link type, you can create links between objects:

```curl
curl --location 'https://api.devrev.ai/links.create' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' \
--data '{
    "custom_link_type": "don:core:dvrv-us-1:devo/demo:custom_link_type/1",
    "link_type": "custom_link",
    "source": "don:core:dvrv-us-1:devo/demo:custom_object/campaign/1",
    "target": "don:core:dvrv-us-1:devo/demo:issue/1"
}'
```

<Callout intent="tip">
When creating a custom link:
- Set `link_type` to `"custom_link"`
- Provide the custom link type ID in `custom_link_type`
- Ensure both source and target objects exist to prevent dangling links
</Callout>

## List custom link types

You can list custom link types in your organization, with optional filtering:

```curl
curl --location 'https://api.devrev.ai/link-types.custom.list' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' \
--data '{
    "source_types_v2": [
        {
            "leaf_type": "issue",
            "leaf_only": false
        }
    ]
}'
```

## Update custom link types

<Callout intent="note">
Now, you want to expand the source types to allow both issues and tickets to have this relationship 
with campaigns.
</Callout>

You can update the existing custom link type to include additional source types:

```curl
curl --location 'https://api.devrev.ai/link-types.custom.update' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' \
--data '{
    "id": "don:core:dvrv-us-1:devo/demo:custom_link_type/1",
    "name": "Link type between issue/ticket and campaign",
    "source_types_v2": [
        {
            "leaf_type": "issue"
        },
        {
            "leaf_type": "ticket"
        }
    ]
}'
```

## Create links between objects with subtypes

<Callout intent="note">
You may want to restrict links to specific subtypes of objects. For example, only allowing issues 
of a particular subtype to be linked to tickets.
</Callout>

Create a custom link type with subtype restrictions:

```curl {11}
curl --location 'https://api.devrev.ai/link-types.custom.create' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' \
--data '{
    "name": "Link between social media issues and tickets",
    "source_types": [
        {
            "leaf_type": "issue",
            "subtype": "social_media"
        }
    ],
    "target_types": [
        {
            "leaf_type": "ticket",
            "is_custom_leaf_type": false
        }
    ],
    "forward_name": "is related to",
    "backward_name": "is related to"
}'
```

This configuration:
- Allows issues of subtype "social_media" to be linked to tickets
- Rejects attempts to link issues with no subtype or with other subtypes

<Callout intent="tip">
To add more valid source subtypes, use the update endpoint to add them to the `source_types` array.
</Callout>

## Deprecate custom link types

<Callout intent="note">
Custom link types cannot be deleted, only deprecated. This ensures that existing links maintain 
referential integrity and prevents data corruption.
</Callout>

To deprecate a custom link type, use the update endpoint and set `deprecated` to `true`:
```curl {6}
curl --location 'https://api.devrev.ai/link-types.custom.update' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' \
--data '{
    "id": "don:core:dvrv-us-1:devo/demo:custom_link_type/1",
    "deprecated": true
}'
```
