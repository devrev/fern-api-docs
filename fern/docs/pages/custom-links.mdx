Links allow you to create organization-specific relationships between any two objects in DevRev. 
This feature enables you to define meaningful connections with custom names that reflect your business processes.

This section provides an overview of links and walks you through the process of creating and managing them. 
By the end of this section, you'll be able to:
1. Define link types
2. Create links between objects
3. List link types
4. Update link types
5. Deprecate link types

## Concepts

### Link type

A link type defines a relationship between two types of objects. It specifies:
- The source object types that the link initiates from
- The target object types that the link can be created to
- A forward name describing the relationship from source to target
- A backward name describing the relationship from target to source

### Supported object types

Links can be created between the following object types:
- custom object
- work (issue, ticket, task, opportunity)
- account, user
- part (product, capability, feature, enhancement)

For more details on customization or custom object concepts, please refer to the documentation below:
- [Customization](./object-customization)
- [Custom objects](./custom-objects) 

## Create link types

<Callout intent="note">
Let's say you want to establish a parent-child relationship between tickets and a custom object 
type called "Campaign". This relationship helps track which tickets are assigned to which campaigns.
</Callout>

To create this relationship, make an API call to create a link type:

```curl
curl --location 'https://api.devrev.ai/link-types.custom.create' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' \
--data '{
    "name": "Link between ticket and campaign",
    "source_types": [
        {
            "leaf_type": "ticket"
        }
    ],
    "target_types": [
        {
            "leaf_type": "campaign",
            "is_custom_leaf_type": true
        }
    ],
    "forward_name": "is parent of",
    "backward_name": "is child of",
    "deprecated": false
}'
```

The link type above defines:
- A descriptive name
- Source types that the link can be created from (ticket)
- Target types that the link can be created to (campaign custom object)
- Forward name ("is parent of") describing the relationship from ticket to campaign
- Backward name ("is child of") describing the relationship from campaign to ticket

## Create links between objects

Once you have defined a link type, you can create links between objects:

```curl
curl --location 'https://api.devrev.ai/links.create' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' \
--data '{
    "custom_link_type": "don:core:dvrv-us-1:devo/demo:custom_link_type/1",
    "link_type": "custom_link",
    "source": "don:core:dvrv-us-1:devo/demo:ticket/1",
    "target": "don:core:dvrv-us-1:devo/demo:custom_object/campaign/1"
}'
```

<Callout intent="tip">
When creating a link:
- Set `link_type` to `"custom_link"`
- Provide the link type ID in `custom_link_type`
- Ensure both source and target objects exist
</Callout>

## List link types

You can list link types in your organization, with optional filtering:

```curl
curl --location 'https://api.devrev.ai/link-types.custom.list' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' \
--data '{
    "source_types_v2": [
        {
            "leaf_type": "ticket,
        }
    ]
}'
```

## Update link types

<Callout intent="note">
Now, you want to expand the source types to allow both issues and tickets to have this relationship 
with campaigns.
</Callout>

You can update the existing link type to include additional source types:

```curl
curl --location 'https://api.devrev.ai/link-types.custom.update' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' \
--data '{
    "id": "don:core:dvrv-us-1:devo/demo:custom_link_type/1",
    "name": "Link type between issue/ticket and campaign",
    "source_types_v2": [
        {
            "leaf_type": "issue"
        },
        {
            "leaf_type": "ticket"
        }
    ]
}'
```

## Create links between objects with subtypes

<Callout intent="note">
You may want to restrict links to specific subtypes of objects. For example, only allowing issues 
of a particular subtype to be linked to tickets.
</Callout>

```curl {9}
curl --location 'https://api.devrev.ai/link-types.custom.create' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' \
--data '{
    "name": "Link between social media issues and tickets",
    "source_types": [
        {
            "leaf_type": "issue",
            "subtype": "social_media"
        }
    ],
    "target_types": [
        {
            "leaf_type": "ticket"
        }
    ],
    "forward_name": "is related to",
    "backward_name": "is related to"
}'
```

This configuration:
- Allows issues of subtype "social_media" to be linked to tickets
- Rejects attempts to link issues with no subtype or with other subtypes

<Callout intent="tip">
The subtype should exist for the corresponding source type.
To add more valid source subtypes, use the update endpoint to add them to the `source_types` array.
</Callout>

## Deprecate link types

<Callout intent="note">
Link types cannot be deleted, only deprecated. This ensures that existing links maintain 
referential integrity and prevents data corruption.
</Callout>

To deprecate a link type, use the update endpoint and set `deprecated` to `true`:
```curl {6}
curl --location 'https://api.devrev.ai/link-types.custom.update' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' \
--data '{
    "id": "don:core:dvrv-us-1:devo/demo:custom_link_type/1",
    "deprecated": true
}'
```

## Quick Reference : Creating Links from Tickets, and Issues

<Callout intent="info">
This section lists common links you can create from tickets and issues. It is not exhaustive.
</Callout>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="From a ticket">

  | From source | Link type | To target |
  | :---- | :---- | :---- |
  | ticket | is related to | ticket, article |
  | ticket | is merged into | ticket |
  | ticket | is follow up of | ticket |
  | ticket | is parent of | ticket, task |
  | ticket | is dependent on | issue |

  <Callout intent="note">
  Only ticket → issue is allowed for "is dependent on". Creating the link in reverse (issue → ticket) is not allowed; the UI auto-flips it.
  </Callout>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="From an issue">

  | From source | Link type | To target |
  | :---- | :---- | :---- |
  | issue | is related to | issue |
  | issue | is duplicate of | issue |
  | issue | is parent of | issue, task |
  | issue | is dependent on | issue |
  | issue | is dependent on | code change |

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Behavior and constraints by link type

| Link type | Multiple incoming to a target | Multiple outgoing from a source | Cycles allowed | Max levels (depth) | Where these limits matter most |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| is parent of | No | Yes | No | 2 | Applies to ticket ↔ ticket and issue ↔ issue parent chains; also when parenting tasks |
| is related to | Yes | Yes | Yes | No fixed limit | General “related” networks are flexible |
| is merged into | Yes | No | No | 2 | Ticket merges (ticket → ticket) |
| is follow up of | No | No | No | Not specified | Constraints are enforced only for ticket → ticket; outside that pair, constraints may not be checked |
| is dependent on | Yes | Yes | Yes | No fixed limit | Ticket → issue, issue → issue, issue → code change |
| is duplicate of | Not specified | Not specified | Not specified | Not specified | Allowed for issue → issue and incident → incident in Codex; no extra constraints configured |
