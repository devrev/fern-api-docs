## Introduction to Model Context Protocol

### What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a revolutionary standard that enables AI assistants to securely connect with external data sources and tools. Think of it as a bridge that allows your AI assistant to interact with your business systems in real-time, providing contextual and up-to-date information.

### Key Benefits of MCP

üîó **Seamless Integration**: Connect AI assistants directly to your DevRev workspace
üîÑ **Real-time Data**: Access live data without manual imports or exports  
üõ°Ô∏è **Secure Access**: Controlled permissions and secure API connections
üöÄ **Enhanced Productivity**: Reduce context switching between tools
üéØ **Contextual Responses**: AI gets full context from your DevRev data

### Why DevRev MCP?

The DevRev MCP server transforms how teams interact with their DevRev workspace through AI assistants. Instead of manually switching between your AI assistant and DevRev, you can:

- **Query DevRev data** directly through natural language
- **Create and update work items** without leaving your AI conversation
- **Search across all DevRev entities** (issues, tickets, parts, users, etc.)
- **Manage sprints and workflows** with intelligent assistance
- **Get instant insights** from your DevRev data

---

## Prerequisites & Setup

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: macOS, Linux, or Windows
- **Python**: 3.8+ (handled automatically by uv)
- **AI Assistant**: Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client
- **DevRev Account**: Active DevRev workspace with API access

### Installing uv (Required)

The DevRev MCP server requires `uv` - a fast Python package installer and project manager.

#### Installation Methods

**macOS and Linux (Recommended):**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**Using Homebrew (macOS):**

```bash
brew install uv
```

#### Verify Installation

```bash
# Check uv version
uv --version

# Check uvx version (should be included)
uvx --version
```

Both commands should return version information.

### Get Your DevRev API Key

1. **Sign in to DevRev**: Go to [app.devrev.ai](https://app.devrev.ai)
2. **Navigate to Settings**: Click your profile ‚Üí Settings
3. **Generate API Key**: Go to Developer Settings ‚Üí Personal Access Tokens
4. **Create Token**: Click "Generate New Token" and copy the key
5. **Store Securely**: Save this key - you'll need it for configuration

<Callout type="warning">
  **Security Note**: Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

### üéØ Efficient Tool Usage

#### Use Specific Searches

- **Be specific**: Instead of "search for issues", use "search for high-priority authentication issues assigned to mobile team"
- **Use namespaces**: Leverage namespace filters to get more targeted results
- **Combine filters**: Use multiple parameters in list operations for precise results

#### Batch Operations

- **Group related actions**: When updating multiple items, describe them together
- **Use timeline entries**: Document important updates and decisions
- **Verify transitions**: Always check valid stage transitions before updating

#### Smart Querying

```
Good: "List open tickets assigned to sarah@company.com with high priority"
Better: "Show me Sarah's high-priority tickets that haven't been updated in 3 days"
Best: "Find Sarah's overdue high-priority tickets and show their current stage transitions"
```

### üîÑ Workflow Optimization

#### Standard Workflows

**Creating Work Items**:

1. Check available subtypes first
2. Set appropriate priority and assignees
3. Link to relevant parts if applicable
4. Add initial timeline entry for context

**Updating Items**:

1. Check valid stage transitions
2. Update status and assignees together
3. Add timeline entry explaining the change
4. Verify the update was successful

**Sprint Planning**:

1. List parts targeting the sprint period
2. Check associated work items
3. Review sprint capacity and assignments
4. Create new items as needed

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Performance

#### API Key Management

- **Store securely**: Never commit API keys to version control
- **Use environment variables**: Configure through MCP environment settings
- **Rotate regularly**: Update API keys periodically for security
- **Monitor usage**: Keep track of API usage and limits

#### Rate Limiting Considerations

- **Batch requests**: Group related queries when possible
- **Cache results**: AI assistants naturally cache recent query results
- **Avoid rapid-fire**: Don't make excessive consecutive requests
- **Use specific filters**: Reduce data transfer with targeted queries

#### Error Handling

- **Check permissions**: Ensure API key has required permissions
- **Validate IDs**: Verify work item and part IDs exist before operations
- **Handle failures gracefully**: Use fallback strategies for failed operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### üö´ MCP Server Not Starting

**Symptoms**: AI assistant doesn't recognize DevRev tools

**Solutions**:

1. **Check uv installation**: Run `uv --version` to verify installation
2. **Verify configuration**: Ensure JSON syntax is correct in config file
3. **Restart AI assistant**: Close and reopen your AI assistant completely
4. **Check API key**: Verify the API key is valid and has proper permissions

```bash
# Test uv installation
uv --version

# Test uvx can run devrev-mcp
uvx devrev-mcp --help
```

#### üîë Authentication Errors

**Symptoms**: "Unauthorized" or "Invalid API key" errors

**Solutions**:

1. **Regenerate API key**: Create a new personal access token in DevRev
2. **Check key format**: Ensure no extra spaces or characters in the key
3. **Verify permissions**: Confirm the API key has required workspace access
4. **Update configuration**: Replace the old key in your MCP configuration

#### üì° Connection Issues

**Symptoms**: Timeouts or "Failed to connect" errors

**Solutions**:

1. **Check internet connection**: Verify network connectivity
2. **Firewall settings**: Ensure DevRev API endpoints aren't blocked
3. **Proxy configuration**: Configure proxy settings if required
4. **Rate limiting**: Wait if you've hit API rate limits

#### üîß Tool-Specific Issues

**Search not finding results**:

- Try different search terms or broader queries
- Check if you have access to the specific namespace
- Verify the data exists in your DevRev workspace

**Work item operations failing**:

- Confirm work item IDs are correct
- Check stage transition validity before updating
- Verify you have permissions to modify the items

**Part management issues**:

- Ensure part IDs exist and you have access
- Check parent-child relationships for validity
- Verify assignee user IDs are correct

### Getting Help

#### Log Analysis

When reporting issues, include:

- Your MCP configuration (without API key)
- Error messages or unexpected behavior
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Your operating system and AI assistant version

#### DevRev Support Channels
