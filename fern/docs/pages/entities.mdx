The following entities are accessible through the DevRev [public API](/about/getting-started).

## Attachments: `artifacts`

An artifact is any attachment to an object inside DevRev. Artifacts include videos, log files, and user profile pictures.

## Identity provider: `auth-connection`

An authentication connection enables users to log in to DevRev through an external identity provider such as Azure AD, Google Workspace, Jump Cloud, or Okta.

For more information for about authentication connections, refer to [External identity provider setup](https://docs.devrev.ai/product/sso-saml).

## Security tokens: `auth-tokens`

Security tokens are required for accessing DevRev. There are four types of security tokens:

- **Application Access Token (AAT)**: Uniquely identifies an application belonging to a dev org.
- **System User Token (SUT)**: Uniquely identifies a system user belonging to a dev org.
- **Personal Access Token (PAT)**: Uniquely identifies a dev user.
- **Session Token**: Obtained by an application to access DevRev APIs on behalf of a customer (or customer).

For more information about security tokens, refer to [Authentication](/about/authentication).

## Product builders: `dev-users`

Dev users are product builders and maintainers within an organization.

## Product components: `parts`

A part is a component of a product, and they can be made of other parts. Parts are the core objects that almost all other objects are linked to.

For more information about parts, refer to [Parts & trails](https://docs.devrev.ai/product/parts).

## Workspaces: `rev-orgs`

Workspaces (or rev orgs) are the organizations that your customers belong to.

## Concepts: `tags` 

Tags are words that you can use as a label to give more context to tickets, issues, users, and every other object in DevRev. Tags create associations between objects and a logical concept. This concept is denoted by a tag's name and description. You can have filters on tags.

## Discussions and events: `timeline-entries`

Work items DevRev objects have a timeline that contains discussions and events. Discussions are comments added by a person or a bot, while events indicate a change of the objectâ€™s state.

## Event responses: `webhooks`

Webhooks enable building custom workflows in response to events on the DevRev platform. A webhook can be thought of as a 'reverse API' that's driven by events rather than requests. While APIs are used to pull data from the system, webhooks are a mechanism for the system to push data to a pre-configured endpoint. Webhooks allow you to receive notifications based on events without having to explicitly make a request.

For more information about webhooks, refer to [Getting started with webhooks](/guides/getting-started-with-webhooks).

## Tickets and issues: `works`

A work item is a record of some work that has to be done for a customer (ticket) or for another builder or maintainer of a part (issue).

For more information about work items, refer to [Tickets](https://docs.devrev.ai/product/tickets) and [Issues](https://docs.devrev.ai/product/issues).
