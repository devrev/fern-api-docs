# Publish a listing to the Marketplace

This guide walks you through the process of submitting your marketplace listing, reviewing it, and publishing it for users to access and engage with. You learn about creating and updating marketplace submissions, the roles of the marketplace publisher and admin, and the steps involved in getting your submission approved. Whether you're new to the DevRev CLI or looking for a refresher, this documentation provides you with the necessary information to go through the publishing process seamlessly. Let's dive in and get started.

## Glossary

### Marketplace

A platform for creators and consumers to collaborate, engage, and conduct transactions. It provides an avenue for distributing your products and services, thereby enabling you to generate revenue from them.

### Marketplace submission

An object used as a proposal for a marketplace listing which marketplace admins can review and approve/reject.

### Marketplace item

Any item in marketplace listings that is available for installation.

#### Marketplace listing

All marketplace items that have the same slug. It is also important to note that at most one item, belonging to a specific marketplace listing, can be in the `published` state.

## Publishing process

The marketplace publisher creates a marketplace submission, requesting the creation of a new marketplace listing or updating an existing one. Once the submission is ready for review, the publisher transitions it to the `waiting for review` state. During this phase, an admin reviews and decides whether to approve or reject the submission. If the admin approves the submission, the publisher can proceed to publish it. However, if the admin rejects the submission, the publisher can update and resubmit it for another round of review.

## Before you begin

To get started with creation of marketplace listings, you need to have the DevRev CLI installed. You can find the [installation guide here](https://developer.devrev.ai/snapin-development/references/cli-install). You also need a snap-in for which the listing will be created. If you haven't created a snap-in yet and need help, [click here](https://developer.devrev.ai/snapin-development/tutorials/overview).

## Get started

1. ### Create marketplace listing

    When creating a new marketplace listing, an initial marketplace submission must be created with all the mandatory properties.

    #### Initial submission

    To create a new marketplace listing, run the following command, which will start a wizard to guide you through the process:

    ```bash
    devrev marketplace_submissions create
    ```

    #### New submission for an existing marketplace item

    When a marketplace listing already exists (there is at least one marketplace item in the `published` or `end of sale` state), we can modify it by creating a new marketplace submission. We can modify the submission as we desire.

    To create a new submission for an existing listing, run the following command, which will start a wizard to guide you through the process:

    ```bash
    devrev marketplace_submissions create
    ```

2. ### Update marketplace submission

    Once a marketplace submission has been created, it can be updated by running the following command, which will start a wizard to guide you through the process:

    ```bash
    devrev marketplace_submissions update
    ```

3. ### Publish marketplace submission

    The newly created marketplace submission is in the `draft` state. In order to publish it, we first have to transition it to `waiting for review` state. This can be done by running the following command, which will start a wizard to guide you through the process:

    ```bash
    devrev marketplace_submissions transition
    ```

    Once the submission is transitioned to the `waiting for review` state, it needs to be approved by a marketplace admin. While in review, the state of the submission is `in review`. Once it is reviewed, the state will be changed to either `approved` or `rejected`.

    <Callout intent="note">
    Submissions whose state is `in review` cannot be modified.
    </Callout>

    If the submission was rejected, we can transition it back to `draft` state and modify it to satisfy the requirements. Once it is updated, we can transition it back to `waiting for review` state to be reviewed again.

    If the submission was approved, we can publish it using the following command, which will start a wizard to guide you through the process:

    ```bash
    devrev marketplace_items publish
    ```

    To make sure that marketplace item was published we can retrieve it using its ID:

    ```bash
    devrev marketplace_items show [marketplace_item_id] | jq '{name: .name, id: .id}'
    ```

    Example:

    ```bash
    devrev marketplace_items show 'don:integration:dvrv-us-1:devo/1:marketplace/1:marketplace_item/1' | jq '{name: .name, id: .id}'
    ```

4. ### Delete marketplace submission

    If a marketplace submission was created by mistake or is no longer relevant, it can be deleted. However, deletion of a submission is only permitted for the owners of the submission and is restricted to submissions that are in the `draft` or `rejected` state.

    You can delete a submission using the following command, which will start a wizard to guide you through the process:

    ```bash
    devrev marketplace_submissions delete
    ```

## Automatic upgrade of marketplace listings

Automatic upgrade is supported for marketplace listings. Once a new version of the listing is published, the respective snap-in will be automatically upgraded to the latest version.

However, there are some criteria that need to be met for automatic upgrade to work:

- The upgrade should not require any user input/action.
- There should not be any new global variables added.
- There should not be any new connections that needs to be configured.

## Sharing marketplace listings

By default, all marketplace listings are accessible to all users. However, if someone wants to share a specific listing with certain organizations only, they should follow the steps below:

1. When creating an initial submission, property __access level__ should be set to `restricted`.
2. Proceed through the review process to obtain approval for the submission.
3. Once the submission is approved, publish it to create a marketplace item.
4. To invite a specific DEV organization to the newly created item, execute the following command:

    ```bash
    devrev marketplace_items invite [marketplace_item_id] [dev_org_id]
    ```

    Example:

    ```bash
    devrev marketplace_items invite 'don:integration:dvrv-us-1:devo/1:marketplace/1:marketplace_item/1' 'don:identity:dvrv-us-1:devo/2'
    ```

Once an organization is invited to a listing, their members can view and install it within their own organization.

When a listing is marked as restricted, it is possible to change the access level to `public`. However, the reverse process, changing the access level from `public` to `restricted`, is not permitted.

When a listing is shared with an organization, this information is retained when creating new submissions for the same listing. Additionally, automatic upgrades function seamlessly, just like in the case of public listings.
