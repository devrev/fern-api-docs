A lot of the time, when you're making calls to the DevRev API, there'll be a lot of results to return. For that reason, we paginate the results to make sure responses are easier to handle.
Let's say your initial call is asking to list all the users in an org; the result could be a massive response with hundreds of thousands of pages. That's not a good place to start.

When you make an API call, it returns a cursor with a random code. If there are more pages available, the response will include a field called `next_cursor` which points to the next page.


```json
{
  "next_cursor": "ufhe492s",
  /* ... Rest of the payload ... */
}
```

If there are no more pages to paginate, the response will not include the `next_cursor` field.

To advance to the next page, include the cursor parameter in your query like this:

```json
.../internal/works.list?cursor="u4hf9fd"
```
