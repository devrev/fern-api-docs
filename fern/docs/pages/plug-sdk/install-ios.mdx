This guide will help you to integrate PLuG using DevRev SDK with your iOS app.

## Requirements

- The latest stable Xcode version, 14.0 or higher, available on the App Store
- Swift 5.7 or later
- Set the minimum deployment target for your iOS application as iOS 15

## Setup

Integrating DevRev SDK using Swift Package Manager (SPM).

1. Launch Xcode and open your existing project.
2. Go to the menu bar and select **File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency**.
3. In the **Add Package Dependency** window, enter the `https://github.com/devrev/devrev-sdk-ios` URL in the **Enter Package URL** field.
4. Click the **Add Package** button to fetch the DevRev SDK package.
5. After successfully adding the package, navigate to the **Build Phases** tab of your app target.
6. Confirm that the `DevRevSDK` is listed in the **Link Binary With Libraries** phase. If not, add it by clicking the **+** button and selecting DevRevSDK from the list.
7. Now that the SDK is integrated, you can import and use it in your Swift code.

## Setting up the DevRev SDK

### Obtain credentials

1. To use the DevRev SDK, you must obtain credentials from the DevRev app **Settings** pages. Go to **Settings** > **Support** > **PLuG Tokens** through the settings icon in the top-left corner.

2. Under the **App Credentials** section, generate the necessary credentials for SDK usage. Remember to save both the **App ID** and **App Secret** as they are required in the SDK configuration.

3. Acquire the **Your Unique App ID** (referred to as `supportID` in the code) by visiting the **PLuG Settings** page.

### Initialization

After obtaining the necessary credentials, proceed to configure the DevRev SDK within your application.

1. Initialization of the SDK is accomplished by invoking the configuration method:

```swift
DevRev.configure(appID:secret:supportID:)
```

For example:

```swift
DevRev.configure(appID: appID, secret: secret, supportID: supportID)
```

2. For UIKit apps, configure the SDK within the `AppDelegate.application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method.
3. For SwiftUI apps, depending on your app's architecture, perform SDK configuration either at the entry point or in the initial view of the app.

### User identification

To use specific SDK features, user identification is mandatory. Follow these steps to ensure proper user identification when using the DevRev SDK:

1. Utilize the `DevRev.identify(_:)` function for user identification.
The function accepts the `DevRev.Identification` structure, with only user ID (`userID`) as a required property. All other properties are optional.

	<Callout intent="note">
	The `DevRev.identify(_:)` function is an asynchronous one ensure that you wrap it in a `Task` when calling it from a synchronous context.
	</Callout>

For example:

```swift
await DevRev.identify(Identification(userID: "foo@example.org"))
```

2. Place the identification function appropriately in your app, preferably after the user logs in. If user information is available at app launch, invoke the function following the `DevRev.configure(appID:secret:supportID:)` method.

### PLuG support chat

**UIKit**:

The support chat feature in UIKit can be displayed either as a modal screen or pushed onto a navigation stack.

To show the support screen, use the overloaded method:

```swift
DevRev.showSupport(from:isAnimated:)
```

- If a `UIViewController` is provided as the `from` parameter, the screen is presented modally.

- If a `UINavigationController` is provided as the `from` parameter, the screen is pushed onto the navigation stack.

For example:

```swift
DevRev.showSupport(from: mainViewController)
```

**SwiftUI**:

For SwiftUI apps, a dedicated view is provided. Use the public view property:

```swift
DevRev.supportView`
```

**New conversation callback**:

For convenience, a callback closure is added, so the host app can access the conversation ID.

```swift
DevRev.conversationCreatedCompletion`
```

For example:

```swift
DevRev.conversationCreatedCompletion = { conversationID in
	print("A new conversation has been created: \(conversationID).")
}
```

### Analytics

The DevRev SDK supports sending custom analytic events using a name and a string dictionary.
To track these events, use the following function:
```swift
DevRev.trackEvent(name:properties:)
```

For example:

```swift
DevRev.trackEvent(name: "open-message-screen", properties: ["id": "foo-bar-1337"])
```

### Sample app

The [repository](https://github.com/devrev/devrev-sdk-ios) includes a sample app showcasing use cases for both UIKit and SwiftUI.

Before using the sample app, follow these steps to configure it with your Apple Developer team and DevRev credentials. For your convenience, the code is marked with compiler error directives (#error) at places that need attention.

1. Add your credentials to either `ContentView.swift` (SwiftUI) or `AppDelegate.swift` (UIKit).
2. Remove or comment out the compiler error lines in the respective files.
3. Configure code signing for the sample target:   
	a. Open the project settings.   
	b. Select the appropriate target.   
	c. Navigate to the **Signing & Capabilities** tab.   
	d. From the **Team** drop-down, select your development team.

## Troubleshooting

- **Issue**: Can't import the SDK into my app.   
	**Solution**: Double-check the setup process and ensure that `DevRevSDK` is correctly linked to your application.

- **Issue**: How does the DevRev SDK handle errors?   
	**Solution**: The DevRev SDK reports all errors in the console using Apple's Unified Logging System. Look for error messages in the subsystem `ai.devrev.sdk`.

- **Issue**: Support chat won't show.   
	**Solution**: Verify that you have called the identification method (`DevRev.identify(...)`) correctly.
