The PLuG SDK is a robust tool designed to elevate your website or application by enhancing our widget’s capabilities. With our SDK, you can seamlessly integrate our feature-rich widget, creating a dynamic and personalized user experience.

## Methods

### Initialize SDK

To get started with the PLuG SDK on your website, call the `init()` method. This method is essential for enabling the SDK’s functionality, including session recording, the chat widget, and the search agent. Initialization is required before you can perform any other actions using the PLuG SDK.

```jsx 
useEffect(() => {
    window.plugSDK.init({
      app_id: <your_unique_app_id>,
    });
  }, []);
```
The `init()` method can accept multiple inputs, which are explained below:

|Input Parameter   |Description   |Values   |Mandatory   |
|---|---|---|---|
|app_id   |This is the unique identifier for your PLuG SDK.    |String   |Yes   |
|disable_plug_chat_window   |The chat widget is enabled by default. Use this option if you want to disable the chat widget.   |Boolean (True or False)   |No   |
|session_recording_key   |This key identifies your session recording account and is required to enable the PLuG SDK session recording features.   |String   |No   |
|enable_session_recording   |This instructs the widget to determine whether to start the session recording.   |Boolean (True or False)   |No   |
|session_token   |This unique token identifies the user interacting with your app.   |String   |No   |
|fetchSessionToken   |Request a new session token.   |Function of type `() => Promise<string>`   |No   |
|primary_text_color   |This determines the launcher color, button text for new tickets and conversations, conversation user text, and more. It should be a valid hex code, such as #f0f0f0.   |String   |No   |
|session_recording_options   |Options for recording observability sessions.   |To view the values [click here](#Start session recording) |No   |
|accent_color   |The accent color of the PLuG affects the launcher, new ticket and conversation buttons, conversation user text, and more.   |String   |No   |
|custom_launcher_selector   |A CSS selector string is used to match the element to which the widget will be attached. You can also set this selector from the PLuG settings on app.devrev.ai. If both sources are set, this value will be considered the definitive source.   |Boolean (True or False)   |No    |
|spacing   |Padding from the launcher: This padding can also be set in the plug settings on app.devrev.ai. If a value is specified in both places, this value will be considered the definitive source. Bottom: Padding from the bottom of the launcher. Side: Spacing from the sides of the launcher   |object `{bottom: string side: string}`   |No   |
|theme   |The color scheme for the launcher and widget.   |light or dark   |No   |
|widget_alignment   |The PLuG widget can be positioned on either the left or right side of the launcher. You can also adjust the widget alignment through the plug settings at app.devrev.ai. If alignment settings are configured in both places, the value from app.devrev.ai will override the launcher setting.   |  |No   |

<Callout intent="note">
When React is in Strict mode, you may receive a warning about `window.plugSDK.init()` being called multiple times. These warnings do not affect the widget's installation or functionality.
</Callout>

### Initialize the search agent

Calling the `initSearchAgent()` method sets up the PLuG search agent on your website. This initialization is required before performing any other actions with the PLuG widget SDK.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  window.plugSDK.init({
    app_id: '<your_unique_app_id>',
    disable_plug_chat_window: true,
});

  window.plugSDK.onEvent((payload) => {
    if (payload.type === 'ON_PLUG_WIDGET_READY') {
      window.plugSDK.initSearchAgent();
    }
  });
}, []);
```

### Shutdown

The `shutdown()` method is used to end the current user session in the PLuG widget. It allows you to clear users' conversations and tickets when they log out of your application.

```jsx
await window.plugSDK.shutdown();
```
After calling the `shutdown()` method, you can use the `init()` method to reinitialize the PLuG widget on your website if you want to display it again in the logged-out version of your application.

<Callout intent="note">
Once the `shutdown()` method is called, all other widget functionalities, such as session recording and Nudges, will also be stopped. You will need to reinitialize the widget to reactivate these features.
</Callout>

### Toggle widget theme

The toggle theme method lets you dynamically adjust the PLuG SDK’s theme, even after the widget has been initialized. This feature allows for real-time theme changes based on your users' preferences.

The method accepts two inputs: `light` and `dark`.

```jsx
window.plugSDK.toggleTheme('light | dark');
```

The parameter is optional; calling `toggleTheme()` will switch between the current themes. Specifying a theme as a parameter allows you to toggle directly to that specific theme.

<Callout intent="note">
The theme specified in this method takes precedence over the theme configured in the PLuG settings in your DevRev app.
</Callout>

### Track events

To track user events using PLuG, utilize the `trackEvent` method available in the PLuG SDK. This method automatically links the event to the active user profile within the widget. For more details on user identification within the PLuG widget, refer to [Identify your users with PLuG](https://devrev.ai/docs/plug/identify-web-user).

```jsx
window.plugSDK.trackEvent(event_name, properties)
```

Sample code:

```jsx
// Sample code for the trackEvent method:
var properties = {
"name" : "John Doe",
"plan" : "Starter",
"payment_method" : "Credit Card",
"expiry_date" : "2024-12-12"
}
window.plugSDK.trackEvent("signed_up",properties)
```

To learn more about tracking events, visit [Track events](/plug-sdk/track-events).

### Toggle widget

The `toggleWidget` method allows you to control the visibility of the PLuG chat widget.

Passing input = true opens the chat widget.

Passing input = false closes the chat widget.

```jsx
window.plugSDK.toggleWidget(true);
```

### Toggle search agent

The `toggleSearchAgent` method allows you to control the visibility of the search agent.

If no input is provided, the method toggles the search bar: opening it if it's closed, and closing it if it's open.

```jsx
window.plugSDK.toggleSearchAgent(true);
```

### Take action from PLuG chat events

This method allows you to listen for events from the PLuG widget. Below are the available `PAYLOAD_TYPES`.
- `ON_PLUG_WIDGET_CLOSED`: Triggered when the PLuG widget is closed.
- `ON_PLUG_WIDGET_OPENED`: Triggered when the PLuG widget is opened.
- `ON_PLUG_WIDGET_READY`: Triggered when the PLuG widget is ready.
- `ON_PLUG_WIDGET_UNREAD_COUNT_CHANGE`: Triggered when the user receives a new message. You can also track the number of unread messages and display them to the user.
- `ON_CONVERSATION_START`: Indicates that the user has started a new conversation.
- `ON_SEARCH_AGENT_QUERY`: Indicates that a new search query has been made in the PLuG search agent.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  window.plugSDK.onEvent((payload) => {
    if (payload.type === PAYLOAD_TYPE) {
      //Your logic goes here
    }
  });
}, []);
```

### Check widget status

Use `isWidgetOpen` method to determine whether your chat widget is currently open or closed.

```jsx
window.plugSDK.isWidgetOpen
```

This returns true if the chat widget is open and false if it is closed.

### Prefill search query in search agent

Use the `prefillSearchQuery` method to prefill a search query when opening and initializing the search agent.

```jsx
window.plugSDK.prefillSearchQuery("search_query");
```

### Start session recording

The widget automatically starts session recording upon initialization. You can specify session recording options by passing the following inputs to the initialization method.

```jsx
PlugStartRecordingOptions {
	sessionReplay: {
		maskAllInputs?: boolean;
		maskInputOptions?: Partial<{
		  color: boolean;
		  date: boolean;
		  'datetime-local': boolean;
		  email: boolean;
		  month: boolean;
		  number: boolean;
		  range: boolean;
		  search: boolean;
		  tel: boolean;
		  text: boolean;
		  time: boolean;
		  url: boolean;
		  week: boolean;
		  textarea: boolean;
		  select: boolean;
		}>;
		captureMouseMove?: boolean;
		captureNetworkLogs?: boolean;
		captureConsoleLogs?: boolean;
	}
}
```

The following table describes the input values mentioned above:


|Option   |Description   |Default   |
|---|---|---|
|maskAllInputs   |  |False   |
|maskInputOptions   |This preference determines whether specific input element types should be masked while capturing the session recording.   |Set to `true` for HTML input elements with `type` set to `email`, `tel`, or `password`. Set to `false` for other HTML input elements. For example, `<input type="email"/>` will be masked, whereas `<input type="text" name="email"/>` will not be masked.|
|captureMouseMove   |This preference determines whether to track complete mouse movements or only clicks.   |False   |
|captureNetworkLogs   |This preference determines whether the session should capture network logs or not.   |True   |
|captureConsoleLogs   |This preference determines whether the session should capture console logs or not.   |True   |

### Add session properties

The `addSessionProperties` method is used to add properties to the session in the form of a key-value map.

```jsx
window.plugSDK.addSessionProperties({
	city: 'Bengaluru',
	region: 'us-east'
});
```

### Restart session recording

The `restartSessionRecording` method is used to restart session recording.

```jsx
window.plugSDK.restartSessionRecording();
```

### Start conversation

The `startConversationContent` method opens the PLuG widget directly to the conversation creation view. It replicates the action of clicking the **Send us a message** button, launching the widget to the conversation initiation screen.

This method also accepts an optional input parameter to pre-fill a message on the conversation creation screen, providing your users with a prompt to start a conversation with your team.

```jsx
plugSDK.toggleWidget(true, 'create_conversation', {
        startConversationContent: 'Hi',
      });
```
