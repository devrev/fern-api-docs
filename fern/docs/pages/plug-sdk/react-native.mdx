This section describes the process of integrating the DevRev SDK with your React Native app.

## Installation

To install the DevRev SDK, run the following command:

```sh
npm install @devrev/sdk-react-native
```

## Set up the DevRev SDK

In DevRev, go to **Settings** > **PLuG Chat** copy the value under **Your unique App ID**. After obtaining the credentials, you can configure the DevRev SDK in your app. 

<Callout intent="note">
The DevRev SDK must be configured before you can use any of its features.
</Callout>

The SDK will be ready for use once you execute the following configuration method.

```typescript
DevRev.configure(appID: string)
```

## Identification

To access certain features of the DevRev SDK, user identification is required.

The identification function should be placed appropriately in your app after the user logs in. If you have the user information available at app launch, call the function after the `DevRev.configure(appID:)` method.

<Callout intent="note">
On iOS, if you haven't previously identified the user, the DevRev SDK will automatically create an anonymous user for you immediately after the SDK is configured.
</Callout>

<Callout intent="note">
The `Identity` structure allows for custom fields in the user, organization, and account traits. These fields must be configured through the DevRev app before they can be used. For more information, refer to [Object customization](https://devrev.ai/docs/product/object-customization).
</Callout>

You can select from the following methods to identify users within your application:

### Anonymous identification

The anonymous identification method allows you to create an anonymous user with an optional user identifier, ensuring that no other data is stored or associated with the user.

```typescript
DevRev.identifyAnonymousUser(userID: string)
```

### Unverified identification

The unverified identification method identifies users with a unique identifier, but it does not verify their identity with the DevRev backend.

```typescript
DevRev.identifyUnverifiedUser(userID: string, organizationID?: string)
```

### Update the user

You can update the user's information using the following method:

```typescript
DevRev.updateUser(identity: Identity)
```

<Callout intent="note">
The `userID` property cannot be updated.
</Callout>

## PLuG support chat

Once user identification is complete, you can start using the chat (conversations) dialog supported by our DevRev SDK. The support chat feature can be shown as a modal screen from the top-most screen.Â 

<Callout intent="note">
This feature requires the SDK to be configured and the user to be identified, whether they are unverified or anonymous.
</Callout>

To show the support chat screen in your app, you can use the following method:

```typescript
DevRev.showSupport()
```

### Creating a new support conversation

You can initiate a new support conversation directly from your app. This method displays the support chat screen and simultaneously creates a new conversation.

```typescript
DevRev.createSupportConversation()
```

### In-app link handling

In certain cases, tapping links in the support chat will open them in the app instead of a browser. You can control whether the chat modal screen should be dismissed after the link is opened by calling the following method:

```typescript
DevRev.setShouldDismissModalsOnOpenLink(value: boolean)
```

Setting this flag to `true` applies the system's default behavior for opening links, which includes dismissing any DevRev modal screens to facilitate handling your own deep links.

### In-app link callback

<Callout intent="note">
This feature is for Android only.
</Callout>

For scenarios where custom handling is needed, links from the support chat can be captured with the following method:

```typescript
DevRevSDK.setInAppLinkHandler((url) => {
	// Perform an action here.
});
```

If a custom handler is not defined, all external and in-app links from the support chat will open using the system's default browser, such as Chrome.

 ## Analytics

<Callout intent="note">
This feature requires the SDK to be configured and the user to be identified, whether they are unverified or anonymous.
</Callout>

The DevRev SDK allows you to send custom analytic events by using a properties map. You can track these events using the following function:

```typescript
DevRev.trackEvent(name: string, properties?: Map<string, string>)
```

## Session analytics

The DevRev SDK offers session analytics features to help you understand how users interact with your app.

### Opting-in or out

Session analytics features are opted-in by default, enabling them from the start. However, you can opt-out using the following method:

```typescript
DevRev.stopAllMonitoring()
```

To opt back in, use the following method:

```typescript
DevRev.resumeAllMonitoring()
```

### Session recording

You can enable session recording to record user interactions with your app.

<Callout intent="note">
The session recording feature is opt-out and is enabled by default.
</Callout>

The session recording feature includes the following methods to control the recording:

| Method                                                               | Action                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|`DevRev.startRecording()`   | Start the session recording.                             |
|`DevRev.stopRecording()`    | Stop the session recording and upload it to the portal. |
|`DevRev.pauseRecording()`   | Pause the ongoing session recording.                     |
|`DevRev.resumeRecording()`  | Resume a paused session recording.                       |
|`DevRev.processAllOnDemandSessions()`  | Stop the ongoing session recording and upload all offline sessions on demand, including the current one.|

### Session properties

You can add custom properties to the session recording to help you understand the context of the session. The properties are defined as a map of string values.

```typescript
DevRev.addSessionProperties(properties: Map<string, string>)
```

To clear the session properties in scenarios such as user logout or when the session ends, use the following method: 

```typescript
DevRev.clearSessionProperties()
```

### Masking sensitive data

To protect sensitive data, the DevRev SDK provides an auto-masking feature that masks data before sending to the server. Input views such as text fields, text views, and web views are automatically masked.

While the auto-masking feature may be sufficient for most situations, you can manually mark additional views as sensitive using the following method:

```typescript
DevRev.markSensitiveViews(tags: any[])
```

If any previously masked views need to be unmasked, you can use the following method:

```typescript
DevRev.unmarkSensitiveViews(tags: any[])
```

### Timers

The DevRev SDK offers a timer mechanism to measure the time spent on specific tasks, allowing you to track events such as response time, loading time, or any other duration-based metrics.

The mechanism uses balanced start and stop methods, both of which accept a timer name and an optional dictionary of properties.

To start a timer, use the following method:

```typescript
DevRev.startTimer(name: string, properties: Map<string, string>)
```

To stop a timer, use the following method:

```typescript
DevRev.stopTimer(name: string, properties: Map<string, string>)
```

### Screen tracking

The DevRev SDK offers automatic screen tracking to help you understand how users navigate through your app. Although view controllers are automatically tracked, you can manually track screens using the following method:

```typescript
DevRev.trackScreen(name: string)
```

## Push notifications

You can configure your app to receive push notifications from the DevRev SDK. The SDK is able to handle push notifications and execute actions based on the notification's content.

The DevRev backend sends push notifications to your app to notify users about new messages in the PLuG support chat.

### Configuration

To receive push notifications, you need to configure your DevRev organization by following the instructions in the [push notifications](./push-notification) section.

### Register for push notifications

<Callout intent="note">
To ensure delivery to the correct user, push notifications require that the SDK has been configured and the user has been identified.
</Callout>

The DevRev SDK offers a method to register your device for receiving push notifications. You can register for push notifications using the following method:

```typescript
DevRevSDK.registerDeviceToken(deviceToken: string, deviceID: string)
```

On Android devices, the `deviceToken` must be the Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) token value. On iOS devices, it must be the Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) token.

### Unregister from push notifications

If your app no longer needs to receive push notifications, you can unregister the device. 

Use the following method to unregister the device:

```typescript
DevRevSDK.unregisterDevice(deviceID: string)
```

The method requires the device identifier, which should be the same as the one used when registering the device.


### Processing push notifications

#### Android

On Android, notifications are implemented as data messages to offer flexibility. However, this means that automatic click processing isn't available. To handle notification clicks, developers need to intercept the click event, extract the payload, and pass it to a designated method for processing. This custom approach enables tailored notification handling in Android applications.

To process the notification, use the following method:

```typescript
DevRevSDK.processPushNotification(payload: string)
```

Here, the `message` object from the notification payload should be passed to this function.

For example:

```typescript
const notificationPayload = {
	// message may be nested based on the notification library
	"message": {
		// ... (the entire message object)
	}
};
const messageJson = notificationPayload["message"];
DevRevSDK.processPushNotification(JSON.stringify(messageJson));
```
#### iOS

On iOS devices, you must pass the received push notification payload to the DevRev SDK for processing. The SDK will then handle the notification and execute the necessary actions. 

```typescript
DevRevSDK.processPushNotification(payload: string)
```

For example:

```typescript
DevRevSDK.processPushNotification(JSON.stringify(payload));
```
