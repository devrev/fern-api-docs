<Tab title="Kotlin">

1. Add the following dependencies to your app's `build.gradle.kts` file to get the latest version of our SDK:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("ai.devrev.sdk:devrev-sdk:<version>")
}
```
2. Our SDK is available on Maven Central. To access it, add `mavenCentral` to your root `build.gradle.kts` file.
```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()

## Set up the DevRev SDK

1. In DevRev, go to **Settings** > **PLuG settings** to obtain **Your unique App ID** (referred to as `supportID` in the code).
