### Swift Package Manager (Recommended)

To integrate the DevRev SDK into your project using Swift Package Manager (SPM):

1. Open your project in Xcode and navigate to the **Add Package Dependency**.
2. Enter the DevRev SDK URL under **Enter Package URL**:
- For HTTPS: https://github.com/devrev/devrev-sdk-ios
- For SSH: git@github.com:devrev/devrev-sdk-ios.git
3. In the **Build Phases** section of your app target, locate the **Link Binary With Libraries** phase and confirm that `DevRevSDK` is linked. If not, add it by clicking **+** and selecting `DevRevSDK` from the list.

Now you should be able to import and use the DevRev SDK in your project.
