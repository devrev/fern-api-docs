# Integrate PLuG with your iOS app

This section describes the process of integrating PLuG using the DevRev SDK with your iOS app.

## Requirements

- Xcode 16.0 or higher (latest stable version available on the App Store)
- Swift 5.9 or later
- Set the minimum deployment target for your iOS application as iOS 13

## Integration

The DevRev SDK can be integrated using either Swift Package Manager (SPM) or CocoaPods.

We recommend integrating the DevRev SDK using Swift Package Manager.

### Swift Package Manager (Recommended)

To integrate the DevRev SDK into your project using Swift Package Manager (SPM):

1. Open your project in Xcode and navigate to the **Add Package Dependency**.
2. Enter the DevRev SDK URL under **Enter Package URL**:
- For HTTPS: https://github.com/devrev/devrev-sdk-ios
- For SSH: git@github.com:devrev/devrev-sdk-ios.git
3. In the **Build Phases** section of your app target, locate the **Link Binary With Libraries** phase and confirm that `DevRevSDK` is linked. If not, add it by clicking **+** and selecting `DevRevSDK` from the list.

Now you should be able to import and use the DevRev SDK in your project.

### CocoaPods

To integrate the DevRev SDK using CocoaPods:

1. Add the following to your Podfile:

```ruby

pod 'DevRevSDK', '~> 1.0.0'

```
2. Run `pod install` in your project directory.

This will install the DevRev SDK in your project, making it ready for use.

## Set up the DevRev SDK

1. Open the DevRev web app at [https://app.devrev.ai](https://app.devrev.ai) and go to the **Settings** page.
2. Under **PLuG settings** obtain **Your unique App ID** (referred to as `supportID` in the code).
3. After obtaining the credentials, you can configure the DevRev SDK in your app. The SDK will be ready for use once you execute the following configuration method.
```swift
DevRev.configure(appID:)
```
For example:

```swift
DevRev.configure(appID: "abcdefg12345")
```

- UIKit apps

Configure the SDK in the `AppDelegate.application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method.

- SwiftUI apps

Depending on your app's architecture, configure the SDK at the app's entry point or initial view.

## Identification

To utilize certain features of the DevRev SDK, user identification is required.

The identification function should be placed appropriately in your app after the user logs in. If you have the user information available at app launch, call the function after the `DevRev.configure(appID:)` method.

<Callout intent="note">
If you haven't previously identified the user, the DevRev SDK will automatically create an anonymous user for you immediately after the SDK is configured.
</Callout>

You can select from the following methods to identify users within your application:

### Anonymous identification

The anonymous identification method allows you to create an anonymous user with an optional user identifier, ensuring that no other data is stored or associated with the user.

```swift
DevRev.identifyAnonymousUser(userID:)
```

### Unverified identification

The unverified identification method identifies users with a unique identifier, but it does not verify their identity with the DevRev backend.

```swift
DevRev.identifyUnverifiedUser(_:)
```

The function accepts the `DevRev.Identity` structure, where the user identifier (`userId`) is the only required property; all other properties are optional.

### Update the user

You can update the user's information using the following method:

```swift

DevRev.updateUser(_:)

```

This function accepts the `DevRev.Identity` structure.
