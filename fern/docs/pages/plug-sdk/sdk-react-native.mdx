This section describes the process of integrating PLuG using the DevRev SDK with your React Native app.

## Installation

To install the DevRev SDK for React Native, run the following command:

```sh
npm install @devrev/sdk-react-native
```

## Set up the DevRev SDK

1. In DevRev, go to **Settings** > **PLuG settings** copy the value under **Your unique App ID**.
2. After obtaining the credentials, you can configure the DevRev SDK in your app. 

<Callout intent="note">
The DevRev SDK must be configured before you can use any of its features.
</Callout>

The SDK will be ready for use once you execute the following configuration method.

```typescript
DevRev.configure(appID: string)
```

## Identification

To access certain features of the DevRev SDK, user identification is required.

The identification function should be placed appropriately in your app after the user logs in. If you have the user information available at app launch, call the function after the `DevRev.configure(appID:)` method.

<Callout intent="note">
If you haven't previously identified the user, the DevRev SDK will automatically create an anonymous user for you immediately after the SDK is configured.
</Callout>

<Callout intent="note">
The `Identity` structure allows for custom fields in the user, organization, and account traits. These fields must be configured through the DevRev app before they can be utilized. For more information, refer to [Object customization](https://devrev.ai/docs/product/object-customization).
</Callout>

You can select from the following methods to identify users within your application:

### Anonymous identification

The anonymous identification method allows you to create an anonymous user with an optional user identifier, ensuring that no other data is stored or associated with the user.

```typescript
DevRev.identifyAnonymousUser(userID: string)
```

### Unverified identification

The unverified identification method identifies users with a unique identifier, but it does not verify their identity with the DevRev backend.

```typescript
DevRev.identifyUnverifiedUser(userID: string, organizationID?: string)
```

### Update the user

You can update the user's information using the following method:

```typescript
DevRev.updateUser(identity: Identity)
```

<Callout intent="note">
The `userID` property cannot be updated.
</Callout>

## PLuG support chat

The support chat feature can be shown as a modal screen from the top-most screen.Â 

<Callout intent="note">
This functionality requires the SDK to be configured and the user to be identified, whether they are unverified or anonymous.
</Callout>

To show the support chat screen in your app, you can use the following method:

```typescript
DevRev.showSupport()
```

### Creating a new support conversation

You can initiate a new support conversation directly from your app. This method displays the support chat screen and simultaneously creates a new conversation.

```typescript
DevRev.createSupportConversation()
```

### In-app link handling

TBD


### In-app link callback

<Callout intent="note">
This functionality is for Android only.
</Callout>

For scenarios where custom handling is needed, links from the support chat can be captured with the following method:

```typescript
DevRevSDK.setInAppLinkHandler((url) => {
	// Perform an action here.
});
```

If a custom handler is not defined, all external and in-app links from the support chat will open using the system's default browser, such as Chrome.
