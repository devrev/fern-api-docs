# Install PLuG search on your website

## Integration code

To get the PLuG search widget to appear on your website and web app, insert the code snippet provided below on every page where you want the widget to appear for website visitors.

### Unique app ID

Ensure to replace the app ID with your app ID which identifies your PLuG search widget. You can access your app ID from your DevRev account by following these steps.

1. In DevRev, go to **Settings** > **Support** > **PLuG Settings** through the settings icon in the top-left corner.
2. Click **Enable PLuG Widget** if it isn't already enabled.
3. Copy your **Unique App ID** from the **Configuration tab**.

### Setup

Place the following code in the `<head>` section of your HTML page:
```html
<script
  src="https://plug-platform.devrev.ai/static/plug.js"                         
  type="text/javascript">
</script>
```

Place the following code in the `<body>` section of your HTML page:
```html
<script>
    window.plugSDK.init({
        app_id: '<your_unique_app_id>',
        disable_plug_chat_window: true,
    });

    window.plugSDK.onEvent((payload) => {
    if (payload.type === 'ON_PLUG_WIDGET_READY') {
        window.plugSDK.initSearchAgent();
    }
    });
</script>
```

### Setup for React

Place this code inside the react component where you want to render the chat widget. Typically you should do it as top level component like `App.js`.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
    window.plugSDK.init({
  app_id: '<your_unique_app_id>',
  disable_plug_chat_window: true,
});

window.plugSDK.onEvent((payload) => {
  if (payload.type === 'ON_PLUG_WIDGET_READY') {
    window.plugSDK.initSearchAgent();
  }
});
 }, []);
```


To toggle `searchAgent`, call the following method on any event required: 
    ```
    window.plugSDK.toggleSearchAgent();
    ```

To prefill search input from outside the window, call the following method:
    ```
    window.plugSDK.prefillSearchQuery(query:"string")
    ```
