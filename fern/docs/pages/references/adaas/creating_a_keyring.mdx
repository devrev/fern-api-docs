# Creating Keyrings

Keyrings are a DevRev-specific mechanism for managing authentication for External Systems.
They are called Connections in the DevRev app.

They provide a secure way to store and manage credentials within your DevRev Snap-In.
This eliminates the need to expose sensitive information like passwords
or access tokens directly within your code or configuration files, enhancing overall security.

Read more about Keyrings in the [developer documentation](https://developer.devrev.ai/snapin-development/references/keyrings).
