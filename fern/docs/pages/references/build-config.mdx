Build configuration is used to configure the build process of the Snap-in. For e.g. It can be used to set the environment variables used during the build process.

This is useful if the developer wants to import libraries from a different registry or wants to use private packages that
require authentication token.

## Specifying the Config

Build config is defined as:

```yaml
build_config:
  environment_variables:
    - name: <Name of the environment variable>
      description: <Description of what the environment variable does>
      type: <Whether the value is a `constant` or in a developer `keyring`>
      value: <variable value or developer keyring name>
```

For example, to import a library that uses the GitHub NPM registry, add
the following variables to the build config

```yaml
build_config:
  environment_variables:
    - name: REGISTRY_NAME
      description: Name of the github registry to import the library.
      type: constant
      value: npm.pkg.github.com
    - name: AUTH_TOKEN
      description: Token to access the registry
      type: keyring
      value: access_token
```

Since "AUTH_TOKEN" is sensitive information that should not be hardcoded in the manifest,
the developer can instead mention the name of the developer keyring and during snap-in version creation
time, provide the developer keyring to take the value from.

```yaml
developer_keyrings:
  - name: access_token
    description: Access token for the GitHub registry
    display_name: Access Token
```

## Using the variables defined in config

If the package is present in private registries, the developer can update the `.npmrc` file in the `code` folder from the template to include the URL of the registry and the token.

For example, to use variables defined in manifest defined in the previous section, the `.npmrc` file will look something like this:

```.npmrc
@githubReg:registry=https://${REGISTRY_NAME}
//${REGISTRY_NAME}/:_authToken=${AUTH_TOKEN}
```

To ensure that the `.npmrc` file is valid and can be used to install the libraries, export the variables defined in the manifest locally with the correct values and install the library

```
  npm install @githubReg/<YOUR_LIBRARY>
```
