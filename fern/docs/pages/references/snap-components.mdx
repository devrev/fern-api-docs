# Snap Components

Snap components enable adding custom UI components defined by snap-kit to the DevRev UI.
These components can be used to display data or interact with the user.
Snap components are defined in the snap-in manifest file. DevRev UI renders these components based on the defined configuration.

Each snap-component has the following properties:

- `surface` : the surfaces where the snap component can be displayed. Currently, only `issue` is supported. // TODO: Confirm this.
- `snap_kit_action_name` : the name of the snap kit action that will be triggered when the action defined in the snap-kit of the snap component is interacted with.
<!-- - `snap_kit_body` : the initial body of the snap kit action that will be rendered when the snap component is loaded. -->

<!-- - `initializer` : references a function that can be called to initialize the snap component. This is useful when the snap component needs to be initialized with data from the server based on the context where it is being initialized. -->

```yaml
functions:
 - name: upgrade_test_function_1
   description: first function

snap_kit_actions:
  - name: show_test_cases
    function: show_test_cases_or_runs

snap_components:
  - name: show_test_cases
    display_name: Test Case Details
    description: Test Case Details
    surface: issue
    snap_kit_action_name: show_test_cases
    <!-- initializer: upgrade_test_function_1 -->
    snap_kit_body:
      {
        "snaps":[]
      }
```

## Format of context passed to snap-kit action

```typescript
// The payload contains details and values of the snap-kit from which the action was invoked.
interface Payload {
  action: {
    block_id: string;
    id: string;
    timestamp: number;
    type: string;
    value: string;
  };
  action_id: string;
  actor_id: string;
  body: {
    snaps: any[];
  };
  context: {
 // id of the object where the snap component is invoked.
    object_id: string;
  };
  dev_org: string;
  parent_id: string;
  request_id: string;
}

interface Secrets {
  actor_session_token: string;
  service_account_token: string;
}

interface Context {
  dev_oid: string;
  // Snap-kit action ID in DONv2 format.
  source_id: string;
  snap_in_id: string;
  snap_in_version_id: string;
  service_account_id: string;
  secrets: Secrets;
}

interface ExecutionMetadata {
  request_id: string;
  // function that is being invoked.
  function_name: string;
  // endpoint for DevRev that can be used to make API calls.
  devrev_endpoint: string;
}

interface InputData {
  global_values: {
    // contains the inputs that are defined in the snap-in.
  };
  event_sources: any;
  resources: {
    keyrings: any;
    tags: any;
  };
}

// Event object passed to the snap-kit action.
interface Event {
 // The payload of the event
  payload: Payload;
  context: Context;
  execution_metadata: ExecutionMetadata;
  input_data: InputData;
}
```
