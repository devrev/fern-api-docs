This section explores how to create a custom user interface using snap-kit and DevRev.

## Defining the surfaces with the API 

... API definition and explanation how to add an snap-in to a given surface.
... Explanation of how to enable handling of snapkit-action.execute to return diffrent snapkits depending on the context from where the call has been made (issue id for example)

## Accessing created snap-in surfaces

After installing and enabling a snap-in on issues, it can be accessed through a button that appears on issue details. Note that the button only appears if there's at least one snap-in defined as accessible from issues.

Clicking on the snap-in button shows a list of all possible snap-in after which clicking on one of the options opens an modal 

### Display modal

By default the snapkit defined in the main snap-in is shown, but in the case `snapkit-action.execute` support for showing diffrent snapkits depending on the context was added a call is made and the custom snapkit is shown instead.
