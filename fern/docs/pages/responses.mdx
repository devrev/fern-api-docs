The DevRev API uses standard HTTP status codes when responding to requests. On success, a `20X` status code is returned along with any response data.

## Success Response 

| Status Code | Status       | Description                                                                               |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `200`       | `OK`         | The request succeeded and the result is contained in the response.                        |
| `201`       | `Created`    | The request successfully created an object and the result is contained in the response.   |
| `204`       | `No Content` | The request succeeded and contains no response data. This is common for object deletions. |

## Error Response 

A request may encounter a set of errors that are common across all the APIs. In the response, a JSON object with a `message` field is provided that contains supplemental information to the encountered error.

<CodeBlock title = "Error Message">
```
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 29
{"message":"route not found"}
```
</CodeBlock>   

| Status Code | Status                  | Description   |
|-------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `301`       | `Moved Permanently` | The target resource's ID has changed, where the `Location` response header contains the updated ID. |
| `400`       | `Bad Request`           | The request is malformed or contained invalid arguments. |
| `401`       | `Unauthorized`          | The user attempted to access an endpoint that requires authentication and no credentials are provided or their validation failed. |
| `403`       | `Forbidden`             | The user isn't authorized to perform the requested action. |
| `404`       | `Not Found`             | The requested endpoint, object, or requested resource doesn't exist. |
| `409`       | `Conflict`          | The attempted object creation conflicted with an existing object, for example, a group with the same name already exists. |
| `429`       | `Too Many Requests`     | The user is currently throttled due to exceeding their permitted rate limit. The `Retry-After` response header contains the number of seconds before the user should retry. |
| `500`       | `Internal Server Error` | An internal error is encountered in the handling of the request which couldn't be processed to completion. DevRev is automatically alerted to any occurrence of this error. The user should retry after a short delay and contact DevRev support if the problem persists.        |
| `503`       | `Service Unavailable`   | A transient error is encountered and the user should retry after a short delay.
