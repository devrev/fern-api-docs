DevRev's server side SDKs reduce the amount of work required to use DevRevâ€™s REST APIs, starting with reducing the boilerplate code you have to write. Below are the installation instructions for the Typescript SDK.

## Installation

```
npm install @devrev/typescript-sdk
```

The version can be found in package.json. The SDK is currently beta. Make sure that your project's package.json contains "type":"module" setting.

## Authorization

Setup an env variable `DEVREV_TOKEN` It will be used as an auth token by default, You can also pass in the url and token in `client.setup()` as a param (see below example). It is also required to run tests.

### Example usage of the beta SDK

```ts
import {client, betaSDK} from "@devrev/typescript-sdk";

const devrevBetaSDK = client.setupBeta({ endpoint: "https://api.devrev.ai",
token: process.env.DEVREV_TOKEN });

async function test(){
    const response = await devrevBetaSDK.worksCreate({title:"New work item!",
    applies_to_part: "PROD-1",
    owned_by:["DEVU-1"],
    type: betaSDK.WorkType.Issue})
    console.log(response)
}

test()
```

### Example usage of the public SDK

```ts
import {client, publicSDK} from "@devrev/typescript-sdk";

const devrevSDK = client.setup({ endpoint: "https://api.devrev.ai", token: process.env.DEVREV_TOKEN });

async function test(){
    const response = await devrevSDK.worksCreate({title:"New work item!", applies_to_part: "PROD-1", owned_by:["DEVU-16"], type: publicSDK.WorkType.Issue})
    console.log(response.status)
}

test()
```
