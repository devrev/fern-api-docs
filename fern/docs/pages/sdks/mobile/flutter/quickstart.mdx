# Quickstart guide

## Requirements

- Flutter 3.3.0 or later.
- Dart SDK 3.7.0 or later.
- Android: minimum API level 24.
- iOS: minimum deployment target 15.0.
- (Recommended) An SSH key configured locally and registered with [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

## Installation

To install the DevRev SDK, run the following command:
```sh
flutter pub add devrev_sdk_flutter
```

It automatically fetches the latest version of our package and adds it to your project's pubspec.yaml file:
```yaml
dependencies:
    devrev_sdk_flutter: <VERSION>
```

Alternatively, you can add the dependency manually by adding the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file under the `dependencies` section and run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

To get the latest version of the SDK, you can check the [pub.dev page](https://pub.dev/packages/devrev_sdk_flutter).

## Set up the DevRev SDK

1. Open the DevRev web app at [https://app.devrev.ai](https://app.devrev.ai) and go to the **Settings** page.
2. Under **PLuG settings** copy the value under **Your unique App ID**.
3. Configure the DevRev SDK in your app using the obtained credentials.

The DevRev SDK must be configured before you can use any of its features.

The SDK becomes ready for use once the following configuration method is executed.

```dart
DevRev.configure(appID);
```

For example:

```dart
DevRev.configure("abcdefg12345");
```

   flutter clean
   rm -rf ios android web linux macos windows
   flutter create --platforms=android,ios .
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. iOS app:

   ```sh
   flutter run -d ios
   ```

   Additional Steps for iOS before running the app:
   1. Change the minimum iOS deployment target version to `15.0`.
   2. Go to the `ios` directory and perform `pod install`.
   3. Open `ios/Runner.xcodeproj` in Xcode and select `Package dependencies -> FlutterGeneratedPluginSwiftPackage -> Package.swift` set iOS version from `12` to `15`.
      ```swift
      platforms: [
         .iOS("15.0")
      ]
      ```
   4. Perform `File -> Packages -> Resolve package versions`.
   5. Build and run the app.
