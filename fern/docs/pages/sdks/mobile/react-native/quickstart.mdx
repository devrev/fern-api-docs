## Sample app (without framework)

A sample app with use cases for the DevRev SDK for React Native has been provided as a part of our [public repository](https://github.com/devrev/devrev-sdk-react-native). To set up and run the sample app:

1. Go to the sample directory:
    ```bash
    cd sample/react-native
    ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
3. For iOS, run:
    ```bash
    pod install --project-directory=ios --repo-update
    ```
4. Start the React Native development server:
    ```bash
    npx react-native start
    ```
5. Run the app on Android using:
    ```bash
    npx react-native run-android
    ```
    or open the `android` directory in Android Studio and run the app from there.
6. Run the app on iOS using:
    ```bash
    npx react-native run-ios
    ```
    or open `ios/DevRevSDKSampleRN.xcworkspace` in Xcode and run the app from there.
