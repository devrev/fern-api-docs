# Quickstart guide for React Native

This guide helps you integrate the DevRev SDK into your React Native app.

## Installation

To install the DevRev SDK, run the following command:

```sh
npm install @devrev/sdk-react-native
```

## Set up the DevRev SDK

1. Open the DevRev web app at [https://app.devrev.ai](https://app.devrev.ai) and go to the **Settings** page.
2. Under **PLuG settings** copy the value under **Your unique App ID**.
3. After obtaining the credentials, you can configure the DevRev SDK in your app.

The SDK will be ready for use once you execute the following configuration method.

```typescript
DevRev.configure(appID: string)
```

## Sample app
A sample app with use cases for the DevRev React Native plugin has been provided as a part of our [public repository](https://github.com/devrev/devrev-sdk-react-native). To set up and run the sample app:

1. Go to the sample directory:
    ```sh
    cd sample
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

3. For iOS, run:
    ```sh
    cd ios
    pod install
    ```

4. Run the app on Android or iOS using:
    ```sh
    npx react-native start
    ```
    Or open `android` directory in Android Studio or `ios/DevRevSDKSample.xcworkspace` in Xcode and run the app from there.
