    ```sh
    cd sample
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

3. For iOS, run:
    ```sh
    cd ios
    pod install
    ```

4. Run the app on Android or iOS using:
    ```sh

    ```
    Or open `android` directory in Android Studio or `ios/DevRevSDKSample.xcworkspace` in Xcode and run the app from there.
