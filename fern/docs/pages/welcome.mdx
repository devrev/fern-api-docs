At DevRev, we're creating OneCRM, a platform that allows developers ("devs") to connect with their customers ("revs") in real-time. We envision developers operating their entire business using code in the next decade, and DevRev is the catalyst for this shift with its strong APIs.
The DevRev API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes and authentication.
If you're new to DevRev APIs, you've come to the right place. Our APIs serve as the foundation for integrating your apps, building automations, and creating custom snap-ins. Start your journey by going through the [entities](/welcome/entities) page, where you can get familiar with the basic concepts and terminologies used in the API documentation. 
You can also refer to our [Postman collection](https://postman.devrev.ai/).

Let's get started with DevRev APIs.

## Prerequisites

First, create a DevRev account or log in.

Every call to a DevRev API must include a PAT. After you create your account, [generate a personal access token](/welcome/authentication#generate-a-personal-access-token--pat-) and store it in a safe place. 

In this guide, you’ll make a call to the [`dev-users.self`](https://docs.devrev.ai/api#/operations/dev-users-self) API which gets the authenticated user's information. You will retrieve the user object created for your account on DevRev. This user object contains information such as a unique identifier, full name, display name, and profile picture.

Every object in DevRev is uniquely identified by an `id` known as DevRev Object Notation (DON). DON `id` can be found in the API response. 
The value `SELF` can be passed in as `id` to reference the logged-in user.

The `display-id` shown in the UI for [work item](https://docs.devrev.ai/product/core#work) objects such as issues and tickets can be used interchangeably with the `id` to enhance usability. In the image below, `ISS-69` serves as an example of a `display-id` for issues.

![Display ID in DevRev UI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86735914/230507371-27eadf22-c866-4e06-aa93-6aeda2ed82f7.png "Display ID in DevRev UI")

Next, you'll want to set up your development environment to connect and interact with the DevRev API.

## Send your first API request

To do this, make a GET request to the DevRev server ("https://api.devrev.ai/dev-users.self") and include the PAT created in the authorization header of the request. 

This guide shows you how to get user information with a GET request using two popular languages as well as cURL:

### Making a GET request 

<CodeBlocks>
  <CodeBlock title = "cURL">
    ```bash
    curl --location --request GET 'https://api.devrev.ai/dev-users.self' \
    --header 'Authorization: <PAT>'
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title = "Python">
    ```python
    import requests

    url = 'https://api.devrev.ai/dev-users.self'
    headers = {
        'Authorization': '<PAT>'
    }

    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        # You can access the response content with response.text
        print(response.text)
    else:
        print(f'Request failed with status code {response.status_code}')

    ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title = "Node JS">
  ```js
  const axios = require('axios');

const url = 'https://api.devrev.ai/dev-users.self';
const token = '<PAT>'; // Replace <PAT> with your actual personal access token

axios.get(url, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': token,
  }
})
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
  ```
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeBlocks>

If everything works, the command line displays the following response for a user named "John Smith Doe":

<CodeBlock title = "Response">
```json
{
    "dev_user": {
        "display_handle": "John Doe",
        "created_date": "2022-01-28T10:45:53.698Z",
        "modified_date": "2022-01-28T10:45:53.698Z",
        "profile_picture": "<logo-url-here>",
        "auth0_user_ids": [
            "auth0|abcd1234eca43c006913f97d"
        ],
        "id": "don:identity:dvrv-us-1:devo/20:devu/40",
        "display_id": "DEVU-40",
        "state": "active",
        "full_name": "John Smith Doe",
        "email": "JohnDoe@devrev.ai"
    }
}
```
</CodeBlock>
