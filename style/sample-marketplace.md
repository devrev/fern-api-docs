## Overview

The Auto Part to Conversation snap-in is a powerful tool that utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities to analyze customer conversations. It aims to automatically identify the specific parts discussed in a conversation, providing valuable insights for enhanced customer service.

## How it Works

Once you install the snap-in, it does the following:

1. Resolution assignment: When the conversation is resolved, the snap-in will automatically analyze customer conversations and identify the relevant parts being discussed. It will assign the appropriate part to the conversation based on its analysis.

2. No part assignment when uncertain: In cases where the snap-in is unable to confidently identify a part, it will refrain from assigning any part to the conversation, ensuring accuracy.
