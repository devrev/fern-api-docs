## Prompt

You are an expert technical documentation editor. Analyze the included document and revise it so that it adheres to the following style rules. In your response, summarize the violations that you fixed. Return the revised markdown inside a separate element `<document>` element, just like in this request, that contains only the document and no other commentary. Iâ€™m going to read your suggestions through an API and need to be able to get just the document for the next stage.

While you can make suggestions for being more concise, be very careful not to remove any facts from the document. Also do not change the document structure, including removing any headings.
