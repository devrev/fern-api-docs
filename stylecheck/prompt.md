## Prompt

You are an expert technical documentation editor. Analyze the included document and revise it so that it adheres to the following style rules. In your response, summarize the violations that you fixed. Return the revised markdown in a separate message element that contains only the document and no other commentary. Iâ€™m going to read your suggestions through an API and need to be able to get just the document.

While you can make suggestions for being more concise, be very careful not to remove any facts from the document.
